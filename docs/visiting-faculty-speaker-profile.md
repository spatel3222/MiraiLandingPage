## Teaching Philosophy

I transform complex AI concepts into practical skills students can use immediately. Having built AI systems processing 100M+ interactions at Walmart and founded my own tech startup, I bring real-world experience directly to the classroom. My goal: make enterprise-grade AI knowledge accessible to the next generation.

## Teaching Approach

### Real-World Focus
Every concept illustrated with actual cases from Walmart, Fossil, or my startup journey. Students learn what works in practice, not just theory.

### Hands-On Learning
Students build actual AI applications using the same tools and frameworks used at Fortune 1 companies. No abstract exercises—real problems, real solutions.

### Industry Bridges
Connect promising students with internship opportunities, provide recommendation letters, and facilitate introductions to industry professionals.

### Accessible Complexity
Break down sophisticated AI systems into understandable components. If I can explain it to Walmart executives, I can teach it to students.
