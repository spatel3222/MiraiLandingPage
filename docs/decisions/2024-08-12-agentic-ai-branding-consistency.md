## Context and Problem Statement

The CRTX consulting page and other site pages were using inconsistent terminology around AI solutions. Some areas used generic "AI agents" while others used the more specific "agentic AI" terminology. This inconsistency could dilute brand positioning and competitive differentiation.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for consistent specialized positioning in emerging agentic AI market
* Alignment with positioning documents that emphasize agentic AI expertise
* Competitive differentiation from generic AI consulting
* Brand consistency across all touchpoints
* Gartner research showing 40% agentic AI project failure rate creates market opportunity

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Use generic "AI" terminology throughout
* Option 2: Use "AI agents" terminology 
* Option 3: Consistently use "agentic AI" terminology across all pages

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 3 - Consistently use agentic AI terminology", because it positions CRTX as a specialist in the emerging agentic AI space rather than generic AI consulting, aligns with existing positioning documents, and creates clear competitive differentiation.

### Positive Consequences

* Clear positioning as agentic AI specialist vs generic AI consultants
* Consistent messaging across all marketing touchpoints
* Competitive advantage in emerging agentic AI market
* Professional credibility through specialized terminology
* Better alignment with industry research and trends

### Negative Consequences

* May require education of prospects unfamiliar with "agentic AI" term
* Potential narrowing of perceived expertise scope
* Need to maintain consistency in all future content

## Implementation Details

Updated terminology across consulting page:
- "AI agents" → "Agentic AI solutions" (Unlimited Scale metric)
- "State-of-art agents" → "Agentic AI frameworks" (Flywheel section)
- "Pre-Built AI Arsenal" → "Pre-Built Agentic AI Arsenal"
- "Transform Your Business with AI" → "Transform Your Business with Agentic AI"
