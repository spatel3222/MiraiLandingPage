# Prompt engineering overview

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

## Before prompt engineering

This guide assumes that you have:

1. A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case
2. Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
3. A first draft prompt you want to improve

If not, we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first. Check out [Define your success criteria](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/define-success) and [Create strong empirical evaluations](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) for tips and guidance.

## When to prompt engineer

This guide focuses on success criteria that are controllable through prompt engineering.
Not every success criteria or failing eval is best solved by prompt engineering. For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.

<Accordion title="Prompting vs. finetuning">
  Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:<br />

  * **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.
  * **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.
  * **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.
  * **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.
  * **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.
  * **Flexibility & rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.
  * **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.
  * **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents
  * **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model's broad capabilities.
  * **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.

# Use our prompt improver to optimize your prompts

<Note>
  Our prompt improver is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Note>

The prompt improver helps you quickly iterate and improve your prompts through automated analysis and enhancement. It excels at making prompts more robust for complex tasks that require high accuracy.

</Frame>

## Before you begin

You'll need:

* A [prompt template](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables) to improve
* Feedback on current issues with Claude's outputs (optional but recommended)
* Example inputs and ideal outputs (optional but recommended)

## How the prompt improver works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process

You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.

## What you get

The prompt improver generates templates with:

* Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude's reasoning process and typically improve its performance
* Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components
* Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output
* Strategic prefills that guide Claude's initial responses

<Note>
  While examples appear separately in the Workbench UI, they're included at the start of the first user message in the actual API call. View the raw format by clicking "**\</> Get Code**" or insert examples as raw text via the Examples box.
</Note>

## How to use the prompt improver

1. Submit your prompt template
2. Add any feedback about issues with Claude's current outputs (e.g., "summaries are too basic for expert audiences")
3. Include example inputs and ideal outputs
4. Review the improved prompt

## Generate test examples

Don't have examples yet? Use our [Test Case Generator](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool#creating-test-cases) to:

1. Generate sample inputs
2. Get Claude's responses
3. Edit the responses to match your ideal outputs
4. Add the polished examples to your prompt

## When to use the prompt improver

The prompt improver works best for:

* Complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning
* Situations where accuracy is more important than speed
* Problems where Claude's current outputs need significant improvement

<Note>
  For latency or cost-sensitive applications, consider using simpler prompts. The prompt improver creates templates that produce longer, more thorough, but slower responses.
</Note>

## Example improvement

Here's how the prompt improver enhances a basic classification prompt:

<Accordion title="Original prompt">
  ```
  From the following list of Wikipedia article titles, identify which article this sentence came from.
  Respond with just the article title and nothing else.

  Article titles:
  {{titles}}

  Sentence to classify:
  {{sentence}}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Improved prompt">
  ```
  You are an intelligent text classification system specialized in matching sentences to Wikipedia article titles. Your task is to identify which Wikipedia article a given sentence most likely belongs to, based on a provided list of article titles.

  First, review the following list of Wikipedia article titles:
  <article_titles>
  {{titles}}
  </article_titles>

  Now, consider this sentence that needs to be classified:
  <sentence_to_classify>
  {{sentence}}
  </sentence_to_classify>

  Your goal is to determine which article title from the provided list best matches the given sentence. Follow these steps:

  1. List the key concepts from the sentence
  2. Compare each key concept with the article titles
  3. Rank the top 3 most relevant titles and explain why they are relevant
  4. Select the most appropriate article title that best encompasses or relates to the sentence's content

  Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags. Include the following:
  - List of key concepts from the sentence
  - Comparison of each key concept with the article titles
  - Ranking of top 3 most relevant titles with explanations
  - Your final choice and reasoning

  After your analysis, provide your final answer: the single most appropriate Wikipedia article title from the list.

  Output only the chosen article title, without any additional text or explanation.
  ```
</Accordion>

Notice how the improved prompt:

* Adds clear step-by-step reasoning instructions
* Uses XML tags to organize content
* Provides explicit output formatting requirements
* Guides Claude through the analysis process

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

* **Examples not appearing in output**: Check that examples are properly formatted with XML tags and appear at the start of the first user message
* **Chain of thought too verbose**: Add specific instructions about desired output length and level of detail
* **Reasoning steps don't match your needs**: Modify the steps section to match your specific use case

## Before you begin

You'll need:

* A [prompt template](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables) to improve
* Feedback on current issues with Claude's outputs (optional but recommended)
* Example inputs and ideal outputs (optional but recommended)

## How the prompt improver works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process

You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.

## What you get

The prompt improver generates templates with:

* Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude's reasoning process and typically improve its performance
* Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components
* Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output
* Strategic prefills that guide Claude's initial responses

<Note>
  While examples appear separately in the Workbench UI, they're included at the start of the first user message in the actual API call. View the raw format by clicking "**\</> Get Code**" or insert examples as raw text via the Examples box.
</Note>

## How to use the prompt improver

1. Submit your prompt template
2. Add any feedback about issues with Claude's current outputs (e.g., "summaries are too basic for expert audiences")
3. Include example inputs and ideal outputs
4. Review the improved prompt

## Generate test examples

Don't have examples yet? Use our [Test Case Generator](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool#creating-test-cases) to:

1. Generate sample inputs
2. Get Claude's responses
3. Edit the responses to match your ideal outputs
4. Add the polished examples to your prompt

## When to use the prompt improver

The prompt improver works best for:

* Complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning
* Situations where accuracy is more important than speed
* Problems where Claude's current outputs need significant improvement

<Note>
  For latency or cost-sensitive applications, consider using simpler prompts. The prompt improver creates templates that produce longer, more thorough, but slower responses.
</Note>

## Example improvement

Here's how the prompt improver enhances a basic classification prompt:

<Accordion title="Original prompt">
  ```
  From the following list of Wikipedia article titles, identify which article this sentence came from.
  Respond with just the article title and nothing else.

  Article titles:
  {{titles}}

  Sentence to classify:
  {{sentence}}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Improved prompt">
  ```
  You are an intelligent text classification system specialized in matching sentences to Wikipedia article titles. Your task is to identify which Wikipedia article a given sentence most likely belongs to, based on a provided list of article titles.

  First, review the following list of Wikipedia article titles:
  <article_titles>
  {{titles}}
  </article_titles>

  Now, consider this sentence that needs to be classified:
  <sentence_to_classify>
  {{sentence}}
  </sentence_to_classify>

  Your goal is to determine which article title from the provided list best matches the given sentence. Follow these steps:

  1. List the key concepts from the sentence
  2. Compare each key concept with the article titles
  3. Rank the top 3 most relevant titles and explain why they are relevant
  4. Select the most appropriate article title that best encompasses or relates to the sentence's content

  Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags. Include the following:
  - List of key concepts from the sentence
  - Comparison of each key concept with the article titles
  - Ranking of top 3 most relevant titles with explanations
  - Your final choice and reasoning

  After your analysis, provide your final answer: the single most appropriate Wikipedia article title from the list.

  Output only the chosen article title, without any additional text or explanation.
  ```
</Accordion>

Notice how the improved prompt:

* Adds clear step-by-step reasoning instructions
* Uses XML tags to organize content
* Provides explicit output formatting requirements
* Guides Claude through the analysis process

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

* **Examples not appearing in output**: Check that examples are properly formatted with XML tags and appear at the start of the first user message
* **Chain of thought too verbose**: Add specific instructions about desired output length and level of detail
* **Reasoning steps don't match your needs**: Modify the steps section to match your specific use case

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs.
This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

<Tip>**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.</Tip>

## Why use examples?

* **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
* **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
* **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

* **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
* **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
* **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

<Tip>Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Example: Analyzing customer feedback">
  Notice that in the "no examples" version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

<Tip>Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.</Tip>

***

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

<Tip>**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!</Tip>

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.
  * Lacks guidance on *how* to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

    | User      | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
    | Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:<br /><br />1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br />2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br />3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br /><br />While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |
  </Accordion>

    With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.

    | User      | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<br /><br />\<thinking><br />1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:<br />   - Goal: Down payment for a house<br />   - Timeline: 5 years<br />   - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br /><br />2. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br />   - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br />   - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br />   - Calculate potential 5-year return:<br />     - Best case (12% annually): \$10,000 \* (1.12)^5 ≈ \$17,623.42<br />     - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = \$5,000<br /><br />3. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br />   - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br />   - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br />   - Calculate 5-year return:<br />     - Guaranteed: \$10,000 \* (1.06)^5 ≈ \$13,382.25<br /><br />4. Consider risk tolerance:<br />   - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br />   - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br />   - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br /><br />5. Historical perspective:<br />   - Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br />   - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br />     - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S\&P 500 up \~82%<br />     - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S\&P 500 down \~2%<br />   - Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term<br /><br />6. Final analysis:<br />   - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal<br />   - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet \~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds<br />\</thinking><br /><br />\<answer><br />I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have \$13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.<br />\</answer> |

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

<Tip>Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.</Tip>

***

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

<Tip>**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!</Tip>

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.
  * Lacks guidance on *how* to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

    | User      | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
    | Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:<br /><br />1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br />2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br />3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br /><br />While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |

    With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.

    | Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<br /><br />\<thinking><br />1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:<br />   - Goal: Down payment for a house<br />   - Timeline: 5 years<br />   - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br /><br />2. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br />   - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br />   - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br />   - Calculate potential 5-year return:<br />     - Best case (12% annually): \$10,000 \* (1.12)^5 ≈ \$17,623.42<br />     - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = \$5,000<br /><br />3. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br />   - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br />   - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br />   - Calculate 5-year return:<br />     - Guaranteed: \$10,000 \* (1.06)^5 ≈ \$13,382.25<br /><br />4. Consider risk tolerance:<br />   - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br />   - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br />   - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br /><br />5. Historical perspective:<br />   - Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br />   - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br />     - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S\&P 500 up \~82%<br />     - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S\&P 500 down \~2%<br />   - Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term<br /><br />6. Final analysis:<br />   - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal<br />   - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet \~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds<br />\</thinking><br /><br />\<answer><br />I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have \$13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.<br />\</answer> |

# Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.

The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

<Tip>**System prompt tips**: Use the `system` parameter to set Claude's role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.</Tip>

## Why use role prompting?

* **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude's performance.
* **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO's brevity or a copywriter's flair, role prompting adjusts Claude's communication style.
* **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task's specific requirements.

***

## How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](/en/api/messages) to set Claude's role:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

<Tip>**Role prompting tip**: Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!</Tip>

  | Assistant | I've reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:<br /><br />1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br />   - Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use.<br />   - Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor's negligence or product defects.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.<br /><br />2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Critical Issue: Damages capped at \$500, including direct damages.<br />   - Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br /><br />3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br />   - Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br />   - Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br /><br />Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |

  | User      | You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We're in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:<br />\<data><br />\{\{FINANCIALS}}<br />\</data><br /><br />Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
  | Assistant | Board members, here's my analysis of our Q2 financials:<br /><br />1. Revenue (\$15.2M, +22% YoY):<br />   - Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.<br />   - Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.<br />   - Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.<br /><br />2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):<br />   - Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.<br />   - Flag: R\&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.<br />   - Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.<br /><br />3. Cash (\$4.1M OCF, \$28M reserves):<br />   - Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.<br />   - Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.<br />   - Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.<br /><br />Strategic Stance: We're threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R\&D by 30%.<br /><br />In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions? |

# Prefill Claude's response for greater output control

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

<Note>
  Prefilling is only available for non-extended thinking modes. It's not currently supported with extended thinking.
</Note>

When using Claude, you have the unique ability to guide its responses by prefilling the `Assistant` message. This powerful technique allows you to direct Claude's actions, skip preambles, enforce specific formats like JSON or XML, and even help Claude maintain character consistency in role-play scenarios.

In some cases where Claude is not performing as expected, a few prefilled sentences can vastly improve Claude's performance. A little prefilling goes a long way!

## How to prefill Claude's response

To prefill, include the desired initial text in the `Assistant` message (Claude's response will continue from where the `Assistant` message leaves off):

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favorite color?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI assistant, I don't have a favorite color, But if I had to pick, it would be green because"}  # Prefill here
    ]
)
```

<Warning>
  The prefill content cannot end with trailing whitespace. A prefill like `"As an AI assistant, I "` (with a space at the end) will result in an error.
</Warning>

### Examples

#### Example 1: Controlling output formatting and skipping the preamble

<Tip>**Power user tip**: Prefilling `{` forces Claude to skip the preamble and directly output the JSON object. This is cleaner, more concise, and easier for programs to parse without additional processing.</Tip>

#### Example 2: Maintaining character in roleplay scenarios

<Tip>**Role-play tip**: Prefilling a bracketed `[ROLE_NAME]` can remind Claude stay in character, even for longer and more complex conversations. This is especially powerful when combined with role prompting in the `system` parameter.</Tip>

    | Assistant (Claude's response)                                 | Ah, what have we here? A most curious specimen, Watson! Let us examine this shoe with a discerning eye. The mud, you see, is not your common London clay, but rather the distinctive reddish hue of the iron-rich soil found only in the environs of Hampstead Heath. And yet, the wear on the sole suggests a gait more suited to the cobblestones of Whitechapel than the gentle slopes of the Heath.<br /><br />Now, observe the laces! They are tied with a particular knot favored by those in the medical profession—doubtless a habit acquired during years of tying surgical gowns. But the scuff marks on the toe box tell a different tale: they are consistent with the kicking motion one might employ in the martial arts, specifically Baritsu.<br /><br />We may conclude, then, that our absent shoe owner is a doctor, possibly a surgeon, who resides in Whitechapel but frequents Hampstead Heath—perhaps for a secret Baritsu practice, away from prying eyes. A most intriguing case, Watson! We must make haste; the game is afoot! |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

    | Assistant<br />\{\{FEEDBACK}} | 1. Accuracy: A<br />   - Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.<br />   - Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.<br />   - Assertion of "game-changer" is justified by significantly better outcomes.<br /><br />2. Clarity: A-<br />   - Concise and well-structured with clear sections.<br />   - Good use of comparative language (e.g., "up 3% from Q1") for context.<br />   - Minor issue: Acronyms like "RCT," "GLP-1," and "GIP" not defined. Consider spelling out first use.<br /><br />3. Completeness: B+<br />   - Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.<br />   - Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).<br />   - Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).<br />   - Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.<br /><br />Overall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies. |

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br /><br />Findings:<br />- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br />- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br />- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br /><br />Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br /><br />Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br /><br />Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

    | Assistant | After reviewing the SaaS contract, I've identified several concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.<br />   - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.<br /><br />Draft email:<br /><br />Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad "service improvement." Please amend Section 7.<br /><br />2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.<br /><br />3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months' fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months' fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.<br /><br />We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{EMAIL}} | Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After a thorough review of the proposed SaaS agreement, our legal team has identified several high-priority concerns that must be addressed before we can proceed:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Current: Broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Concern: Potential unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br />   - Proposed Change: Limit data use to direct service provision. Any use for improvement, analytics, or marketing must be opt-in, revocable, and anonymized.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Current: 99.5% uptime guarantee.<br />   - Concern: Up to 43.8 hours of downtime per year, risking operational disruptions.<br />   - Proposed Change: 99.99% uptime with tiered service credits. E.g., 10% credit for \<99.99%, 25% for \<99.9%, 50% for \<99.5%.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Current: Cap at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Concern: Grossly inadequate for data breaches, IP theft, or prolonged outages.<br />   - Proposed Change: 12 months' fees for general liability. Uncapped for data breaches, willful misconduct, IP infringement.<br /><br />These changes are non-negotiable for us. They align with industry standards and our commitment to data security, operational excellence, and fiduciary responsibility. We value the potential of our partnership, and addressing these will set a strong foundation.<br /><br />Please have your legal team review and incorporate these changes. We're happy to discuss further to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant | 1. Tone:<br />   - Professional and assertive without being confrontational.<br />   - Use of "non-negotiable" is strong but justified given the criticality of the issues.<br />   - Collaborative language ("we value," "happy to discuss") balances the firmness, maintaining a constructive tone.<br /><br />2. Clarity:<br />   - Excellent structuring: Current state, concern, and proposed change for each issue.<br />   - Technical terms (e.g., "EBITDA," "tiered service credits") are appropriate for a B2B SaaS context.<br />   - Action items are clear: vendor's legal team to review and incorporate changes.<br /><br />3. Professionalism:<br />   - Focuses on mutual benefit and industry standards, not just our demands.<br />   - Mentions broader responsibilities (data security, operational excellence, fiduciary duty), elevating the discussion.<br />   - Offers further discussion, showing commitment to understanding and resolving issues.<br /><br />Overall, the email strikes the right balance of assertiveness and collaboration. It clearly articulates our concerns, proposes specific solutions, and maintains a professional, partnership-oriented tone. No revisions needed; proceed with sending. |

Scalability:<br />   + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.<br />   + Microservices allow independent scaling of components.<br />   - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.<br />   - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.<br /><br />2. Security:<br />   + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.<br />   + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.<br />   - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.<br />   - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.<br /><br />3. Cost-effectiveness:<br />   + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.<br />   + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.<br />   - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.<br />   - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br /><br />## Detailed Analysis<br /><br />### 1. Scalability: B+<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br />- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br />- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br /><br />### 2. Security: B-<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br />- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br />- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br />- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br /><br />### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br />- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br />- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br />- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br /><br />## Recommendations<br /><br />1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br /><br />2. **Security Hardening**:<br />   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br />   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br />   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br /><br />3. **Cost Optimization**:<br />   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br />   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br />   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br /><br />4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br />   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br />   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br /><br />With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br /><br />Findings:<br />- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br />- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br />- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br /><br />Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br /><br />Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br /><br />Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.<br />   - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.<br /><br />Draft email:<br /><br />Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad "service improvement." Please amend Section 7.<br /><br />2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.<br /><br />3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months' fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months' fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.<br /><br />We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{EMAIL}} | Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After a thorough review of the proposed SaaS agreement, our legal team has identified several high-priority concerns that must be addressed before we can proceed:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Current: Broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Concern: Potential unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br />   - Proposed Change: Limit data use to direct service provision. Any use for improvement, analytics, or marketing must be opt-in, revocable, and anonymized.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Current: 99.5% uptime guarantee.<br />   - Concern: Up to 43.8 hours of downtime per year, risking operational disruptions.<br />   - Proposed Change: 99.99% uptime with tiered service credits. E.g., 10% credit for \<99.99%, 25% for \<99.9%, 50% for \<99.5%.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Current: Cap at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Concern: Grossly inadequate for data breaches, IP theft, or prolonged outages.<br />   - Proposed Change: 12 months' fees for general liability. Uncapped for data breaches, willful misconduct, IP infringement.<br /><br />These changes are non-negotiable for us. They align with industry standards and our commitment to data security, operational excellence, and fiduciary responsibility. We value the potential of our partnership, and addressing these will set a strong foundation.<br /><br />Please have your legal team review and incorporate these changes. We're happy to discuss further to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant | 1. Tone:<br />   - Professional and assertive without being confrontational.<br />   - Use of "non-negotiable" is strong but justified given the criticality of the issues.<br />   - Collaborative language ("we value," "happy to discuss") balances the firmness, maintaining a constructive tone.<br /><br />2. Clarity:<br />   - Excellent structuring: Current state, concern, and proposed change for each issue.<br />   - Technical terms (e.g., "EBITDA," "tiered service credits") are appropriate for a B2B SaaS context.<br />   - Action items are clear: vendor's legal team to review and incorporate changes.<br /><br />3. Professionalism:<br />   - Focuses on mutual benefit and industry standards, not just our demands.<br />   - Mentions broader responsibilities (data security, operational excellence, fiduciary duty), elevating the discussion.<br />   - Offers further discussion, showing commitment to understanding and resolving issues.<br /><br />Overall, the email strikes the right balance of assertiveness and collaboration. It clearly articulates our concerns, proposes specific solutions, and maintains a professional, partnership-oriented tone. No revisions needed; proceed with sending. |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{ANALYSIS}} | 1. Scalability:<br />   + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.<br />   + Microservices allow independent scaling of components.<br />   - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.<br />   - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.<br /><br />2. Security:<br />   + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.<br />   + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.<br />   - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.<br />   - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.<br /><br />3. Cost-effectiveness:<br />   + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.<br />   + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.<br />   - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.<br />   - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br /><br />## Detailed Analysis<br /><br />### 1. Scalability: B+<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br />- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br />- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br /><br />### 2. Security: B-<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br />- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br />- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br />- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br /><br />### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br />- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br />- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br />- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br /><br />## Recommendations<br /><br />1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br /><br />2. **Security Hardening**:<br />   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br />   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br />   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br /><br />3. **Cost Optimization**:<br />   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br />   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br />   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br /><br />4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br />   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br />   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br /><br />With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br /><br />Findings:<br />- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br />- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br />- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br /><br />Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br /><br />Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br /><br />Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.<br />   - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.<br /><br />Draft email:<br /><br />Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad "service improvement." Please amend Section 7.<br /><br />2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.<br /><br />3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months' fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months' fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.<br /><br />We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{EMAIL}} | Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After a thorough review of the proposed SaaS agreement, our legal team has identified several high-priority concerns that must be addressed before we can proceed:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Current: Broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Concern: Potential unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br />   - Proposed Change: Limit data use to direct service provision. Any use for improvement, analytics, or marketing must be opt-in, revocable, and anonymized.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Current: 99.5% uptime guarantee.<br />   - Concern: Up to 43.8 hours of downtime per year, risking operational disruptions.<br />   - Proposed Change: 99.99% uptime with tiered service credits. E.g., 10% credit for \<99.99%, 25% for \<99.9%, 50% for \<99.5%.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Current: Cap at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Concern: Grossly inadequate for data breaches, IP theft, or prolonged outages.<br />   - Proposed Change: 12 months' fees for general liability. Uncapped for data breaches, willful misconduct, IP infringement.<br /><br />These changes are non-negotiable for us. They align with industry standards and our commitment to data security, operational excellence, and fiduciary responsibility. We value the potential of our partnership, and addressing these will set a strong foundation.<br /><br />Please have your legal team review and incorporate these changes. We're happy to discuss further to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant | 1. Tone:<br />   - Professional and assertive without being confrontational.<br />   - Use of "non-negotiable" is strong but justified given the criticality of the issues.<br />   - Collaborative language ("we value," "happy to discuss") balances the firmness, maintaining a constructive tone.<br /><br />2. Clarity:<br />   - Excellent structuring: Current state, concern, and proposed change for each issue.<br />   - Technical terms (e.g., "EBITDA," "tiered service credits") are appropriate for a B2B SaaS context.<br />   - Action items are clear: vendor's legal team to review and incorporate changes.<br /><br />3. Professionalism:<br />   - Focuses on mutual benefit and industry standards, not just our demands.<br />   - Mentions broader responsibilities (data security, operational excellence, fiduciary duty), elevating the discussion.<br />   - Offers further discussion, showing commitment to understanding and resolving issues.<br /><br />Overall, the email strikes the right balance of assertiveness and collaboration. It clearly articulates our concerns, proposes specific solutions, and maintains a professional, partnership-oriented tone. No revisions needed; proceed with sending. |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{ANALYSIS}} | 1. Scalability:<br />   + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.<br />   + Microservices allow independent scaling of components.<br />   - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.<br />   - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.<br /><br />2. Security:<br />   + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.<br />   + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.<br />   - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.<br />   - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.<br /><br />3. Cost-effectiveness:<br />   + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.<br />   + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.<br />   - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.<br />   - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br /><br />## Detailed Analysis<br /><br />### 1. Scalability: B+<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br />- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br />- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br /><br />### 2. Security: B-<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br />- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br />- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br />- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br /><br />### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br />- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br />- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br />- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br /><br />## Recommendations<br /><br />1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br /><br />2. **Security Hardening**:<br />   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br />   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br />   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br /><br />3. **Cost Optimization**:<br />   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br />   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br />   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br /><br />4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br />   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br />   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br /><br />With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br /><br />Findings:<br />- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br />- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br />- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br /><br />Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br /><br />Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br /><br />Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.<br />   - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.<br /><br />Draft email:<br /><br />Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad "service improvement." Please amend Section 7.<br /><br />2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.<br /><br />3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months' fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months' fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.<br /><br />We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{EMAIL}} | Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After a thorough review of the proposed SaaS agreement, our legal team has identified several high-priority concerns that must be addressed before we can proceed:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Current: Broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Concern: Potential unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br />   - Proposed Change: Limit data use to direct service provision. Any use for improvement, analytics, or marketing must be opt-in, revocable, and anonymized.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Current: 99.5% uptime guarantee.<br />   - Concern: Up to 43.8 hours of downtime per year, risking operational disruptions.<br />   - Proposed Change: 99.99% uptime with tiered service credits. E.g., 10% credit for \<99.99%, 25% for \<99.9%, 50% for \<99.5%.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Current: Cap at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Concern: Grossly inadequate for data breaches, IP theft, or prolonged outages.<br />   - Proposed Change: 12 months' fees for general liability. Uncapped for data breaches, willful misconduct, IP infringement.<br /><br />These changes are non-negotiable for us. They align with industry standards and our commitment to data security, operational excellence, and fiduciary responsibility. We value the potential of our partnership, and addressing these will set a strong foundation.<br /><br />Please have your legal team review and incorporate these changes. We're happy to discuss further to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant | 1. Tone:<br />   - Professional and assertive without being confrontational.<br />   - Use of "non-negotiable" is strong but justified given the criticality of the issues.<br />   - Collaborative language ("we value," "happy to discuss") balances the firmness, maintaining a constructive tone.<br /><br />2. Clarity:<br />   - Excellent structuring: Current state, concern, and proposed change for each issue.<br />   - Technical terms (e.g., "EBITDA," "tiered service credits") are appropriate for a B2B SaaS context.<br />   - Action items are clear: vendor's legal team to review and incorporate changes.<br /><br />3. Professionalism:<br />   - Focuses on mutual benefit and industry standards, not just our demands.<br />   - Mentions broader responsibilities (data security, operational excellence, fiduciary duty), elevating the discussion.<br />   - Offers further discussion, showing commitment to understanding and resolving issues.<br /><br />Overall, the email strikes the right balance of assertiveness and collaboration. It clearly articulates our concerns, proposes specific solutions, and maintains a professional, partnership-oriented tone. No revisions needed; proceed with sending. |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{ANALYSIS}} | 1. Scalability:<br />   + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.<br />   + Microservices allow independent scaling of components.<br />   - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.<br />   - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.<br /><br />2. Security:<br />   + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.<br />   + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.<br />   - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.<br />   - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.<br /><br />3. Cost-effectiveness:<br />   + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.<br />   + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.<br />   - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.<br />   - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br /><br />## Detailed Analysis<br /><br />### 1. Scalability: B+<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br />- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br />- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br /><br />### 2. Security: B-<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br />- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br />- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br />- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br /><br />### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br />- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br />- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br />- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br /><br />## Recommendations<br /><br />1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br /><br />2. **Security Hardening**:<br />   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br />   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br />   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br /><br />3. **Cost Optimization**:<br />   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br />   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br />   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br /><br />4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br />   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br />   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br /><br />With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

# Using the Evaluation Tool

> The [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) features an **Evaluation tool** that allows you to test your prompts under various scenarios.

## Accessing the Evaluate Feature

To get started with the Evaluation tool:

1. Open the Claude Console and navigate to the prompt editor.
2. After composing your prompt, look for the 'Evaluate' tab at the top of the screen.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=663abe685548444261647cce0baefe9c" alt="Accessing Evaluate Feature" data-og-width="1999" width="1999" data-og-height="1061" height="1061" data-path="images/access_evaluate.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="2" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=d8b903a38366bd5b123b4d4f2195f850 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=9e0ec4080716507bc02820943b2e48f1 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=01a9e18c4b67a487c0c7485c05a98f07 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=52677a88eedc2403bbb371dc101c81e4 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=bc938506a6d1a1bcb6c110d6b1815db8 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5/images/access_evaluate.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=LF5WV0SNF6oudpT5&q=85&s=861bc715fdba424eaeab91190c8f49ed 2500w" />

<Tip>
  Ensure your prompt includes at least 1-2 dynamic variables using the double brace syntax: \{\{variable}}. This is required for creating eval test sets.
</Tip>

## Generating Prompts

The Console offers a built-in [prompt generator](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator) powered by Claude Opus 4.1:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Generate Prompt'">
    Clicking the 'Generate Prompt' helper tool will open a modal that allows you to enter your task information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your task">
    Describe your desired task (e.g., "Triage inbound customer support requests") with as much or as little detail as you desire. The more context you include, the more Claude can tailor its generated prompt to your specific needs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your prompt">
    Clicking the orange 'Generate Prompt' button at the bottom will have Claude generate a high quality prompt for you. You can then further improve those prompts using the Evaluation screen in the Console.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This feature makes it easier to create prompts with the appropriate variable syntax for evaluation.

## Creating Test Cases

When you access the Evaluation screen, you have several options to create test cases:

1. Click the '+ Add Row' button at the bottom left to manually add a case.
2. Use the 'Generate Test Case' feature to have Claude automatically generate test cases for you.
3. Import test cases from a CSV file.

To use the 'Generate Test Case' feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on 'Generate Test Case'">
    Claude will generate test cases for you, one row at a time for each time you click the button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit generation logic (optional)">
    You can also edit the test case generation logic by clicking on the arrow dropdown to the right of the 'Generate Test Case' button, then on 'Show generation logic' at the top of the Variables window that pops up. You may have to click \`Generate' on the top right of this window to populate initial generation logic.

    Editing this allows you to customize and fine tune the test cases that Claude generates to greater precision and specificity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here's an example of a populated Evaluation screen with several test cases:

<Note>
  If you update your original prompt text, you can re-run the entire eval suite against the new prompt to see how changes affect performance across all test cases.

## Tips for Effective Evaluation

<Accordion title="Prompt Structure for Evaluation">
  To make the most of the Evaluation tool, structure your prompts with clear input and output formats. For example:

  ```
  In this task, you will generate a cute one sentence story that incorporates two elements: a color and a sound.
  The color to include in the story is:
  <color>
  {{COLOR}}
  </color>
  The sound to include in the story is:
  <sound>
  {{SOUND}}
  </sound>
  Here are the steps to generate the story:
  1. Think of an object, animal, or scene that is commonly associated with the color provided. For example, if the color is "blue", you might think of the sky, the ocean, or a bluebird.
  2. Imagine a simple action, event or scene involving the colored object/animal/scene you identified and the sound provided. For instance, if the color is "blue" and the sound is "whistle", you might imagine a bluebird whistling a tune.
  3. Describe the action, event or scene you imagined in a single, concise sentence. Focus on making the sentence cute, evocative and imaginative. For example: "A cheerful bluebird whistled a merry melody as it soared through the azure sky."
  Please keep your story to one sentence only. Aim to make that sentence as charming and engaging as possible while naturally incorporating the given color and sound.

## Understanding and comparing results

The Evaluation tool offers several features to help you refine your prompts:

1. **Side-by-side comparison**: Compare the outputs of two or more prompts to quickly see the impact of your changes.
2. **Quality grading**: Grade response quality on a 5-point scale to track improvements in response quality per prompt.
3. **Prompt versioning**: Create new versions of your prompt and re-run the test suite to quickly iterate and improve results.

By reviewing results across test cases and comparing different prompt versions, you can spot patterns and make informed adjustments to your prompt more efficiently.

# Reducing latency

Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to process a prompt and and generate an output. Latency can be influenced by various factors, such as the size of the model, the complexity of the prompt, and the underlying infrastucture supporting the model and point of interaction.

<Note>
  It's always better to first engineer a prompt that works well without model or prompt constraints, and then try latency reduction strategies afterward. Trying to reduce latency prematurely might prevent you from discovering what top performance looks like.
</Note>

## How to measure latency

When discussing latency, you may come across several terms and measurements:

* **Baseline latency**: This is the time taken by the model to process the prompt and generate the response, without considering the input and output tokens per second. It provides a general idea of the model's speed.
* **Time to first token (TTFT)**: This metric measures the time it takes for the model to generate the first token of the response, from when the prompt was sent. It's particularly relevant when you're using streaming (more on that later) and want to provide a responsive experience to your users.

For a more in-depth understanding of these terms, check out our [glossary](/en/docs/about-claude/glossary).

## How to reduce latency

### 1. Choose the right model

One of the most straightforward ways to reduce latency is to select the appropriate model for your use case. Anthropic offers a [range of models](/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) with different capabilities and performance characteristics. Consider your specific requirements and choose the model that best fits your needs in terms of speed and output quality. For more details about model metrics, see our [models overview](/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) page.

### 2. Optimize prompt and output length

Minimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output, while still maintaining high performance. The fewer tokens the model has to process and generate, the faster the response will be.

Here are some tips to help you optimize your prompts and outputs:

* **Be clear but concise**: Aim to convey your intent clearly and concisely in the prompt. Avoid unnecessary details or redundant information, while keeping in mind that [claude lacks context](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct) on your use case and may not make the intended leaps of logic if instructions are unclear.
* **Ask for shorter responses:**: Ask Claude directly to be concise. The Claude 3 family of models has improved steerability over previous generations. If Claude is outputting unwanted length, ask Claude to [curb its chattiness](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct).
  <Tip> Due to how LLMs count [tokens](/en/docs/about-claude/glossary#tokens) instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.</Tip>
* **Set appropriate output limits**: Use the `max_tokens` parameter to set a hard limit on the maximum length of the generated response. This prevents Claude from generating overly long outputs.
  > **Note**: When the response reaches `max_tokens` tokens, the response will be cut off, perhaps midsentence or mid-word, so this is a blunt technique that may require post-processing and is usually most appropriate for multiple choice or short answer responses where the answer comes right at the beginning.
* **Experiment with temperature**: The `temperature` [parameter](/en/api/messages) controls the randomness of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) can sometimes lead to more focused and shorter responses, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) may result in more diverse but potentially longer outputs.

Finding the right balance between prompt clarity, output quality, and token count may require some experimentation.

### 3. Leverage streaming

Streaming is a feature that allows the model to start sending back its response before the full output is complete. This can significantly improve the perceived responsiveness of your application, as users can see the model's output in real-time.

With streaming enabled, you can process the model's output as it arrives, updating your user interface or performing other tasks in parallel. This can greatly enhance the user experience and make your application feel more interactive and responsive.

# Streaming refusals

Starting with Claude 4 models, streaming responses from Claude's API return **`stop_reason`: `"refusal"`** when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations. This new safety feature helps maintain content compliance during real-time streaming.

## API response format

When streaming classifiers detect content that violates our policies, the API returns this response:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello.."
    }
  ],
  "stop_reason": "refusal"
}
```

<Warning>
  No additional refusal message is included. You must handle the response and provide appropriate user-facing messaging.
</Warning>

## Reset context after refusal

When you receive **`stop_reason`: `refusal`**, you must reset the conversation context **by removing or updating the turn that was refused** before continuing. Attempting to continue without resetting will result in continued refusals.

<Note>
  Usage metrics are still provided in the response for billing purposes, even when the response is refused.

  You will be billed for output tokens up until the refusal.
</Note>

## Implementation guide

Here's how to detect and handle streaming refusals in your application:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  # Stream request and check for refusal
  response=$(curl -N https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
    --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    --header "content-type: application/json" \
    --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    --data '{
      "model": "claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
      "max_tokens": 256,
      "stream": true
    }')

  # Check for refusal in the stream
  if echo "$response" | grep -q '"stop_reason":"refusal"'; then
    echo "Response refused - resetting conversation context"
    # Reset your conversation state here
  fi
  ```

  ```python Python
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()
  messages = []

  def reset_conversation():
      """Reset conversation context after refusal"""
      global messages
      messages = []
      print("Conversation reset due to refusal")

  try:
      with client.messages.stream(
          max_tokens=1024,
          messages=messages + [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
          model="claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
      ) as stream:
          for event in stream:
              # Check for refusal in message delta
              if hasattr(event, 'type') and event.type == 'message_delta':
                  if event.delta.stop_reason == 'refusal':
                      reset_conversation()
                      break
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const client = new Anthropic();
  let messages: any[] = [];

  function resetConversation() {
    // Reset conversation context after refusal
    messages = [];
    console.log('Conversation reset due to refusal');
  }

  try {
    const stream = await client.messages.stream({
      messages: [...messages, { role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      model: 'claude-opus-4-1-20250805',
      max_tokens: 1024,
    });

    for await (const event of stream) {
      // Check for refusal in message delta
      if (event.type === 'message_delta' && event.delta.stop_reason === 'refusal') {
        resetConversation();
        break;
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you need to test refusal handling in your application, you can use this special test string as your prompt: `ANTHROPIC_MAGIC_STRING_TRIGGER_REFUSAL_1FAEFB6177B4672DEE07F9D3AFC62588CCD2631EDCF22E8CCC1FB35B501C9C86`
</Note>

## Current refusal types

The API currently handles refusals in three different ways:

| Refusal Type                       | Response Format              | When It Occurs                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Streaming classifier refusals      | **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** | During streaming when content violates policies |
| API input and copyright validation | 400 error codes              | When input fails validation checks              |
| Model-generated refusals           | Standard text responses      | When the model itself decides to refuse         |

<Note>
  Future API versions will expand the **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** pattern to unify refusal handling across all types.
</Note>

## Best practices

* **Monitor for refusals**: Include **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** checks in your error handling
* **Reset automatically**: Implement automatic context reset when refusals are detected
* **Provide custom messaging**: Create user-friendly messages for better UX when refusals occur
* **Track refusal patterns**: Monitor refusal frequency to identify potential issues with your prompts

## Migration notes

* Future models will expand this pattern to other refusal types
* Plan your error handling to accommodate future unification of refusal responses
