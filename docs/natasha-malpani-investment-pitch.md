## The Connection: Science Meets Story in AI

Hi Natasha,

Your thesis on "AI-native founders building at the intersection of science and story" perfectly aligns with what I'm building after architecting Walmart's conversational AI platform (including Sparky and other decision bots) that processes 100M+ conversations annually.

## The Problem I Solved at Walmart, Now Solving for Everyone

At Walmart, I worked with 50+ internal teams who all needed the same thing: AI capabilities that deliver business outcomes, not just tech demos. We built a platform that democratized AI creation—letting teams focus on their unique business logic while we handled the complex AI infrastructure. This reduced time-to-market from months to weeks and increased business impact by 50%.

Now I'm building this as a stealth startup: **an AI platform that lets companies build decision-ready AI systems in days, not months**, focusing on business outcomes over basic use cases.

## Why This Matters Now (Connecting to Your Article's Thesis)

Your article on "Search & Discovery: From Queries to Decisions" captures exactly what we're enabling. As you wrote, search is evolving from "find" to "understand and do"—and the money follows the decision point. My platform enables companies to build these decision-layer AI systems without reinventing the wheel each time.

**What makes this different:**
- **Science**: Battle-tested architecture from processing 100M+ enterprise conversations
- **Story**: Every company can now build their own "Sparky"—AI that understands their unique context and takes action
- **Scale**: What took Walmart months with massive resources, mid-market companies can now do in weeks

## The Founder-Market Fit

My journey uniquely positions me for this:
- **Built and exited** an IoT startup (25% market share capture)
- **Scaled AI at Fortune 1** (Walmart's conversational AI platform)
- **Lived both sides of M&A** (been acquired and driven acquisitions)
- **Deep technical range** (semiconductors → consumer electronics → e-commerce AI)

This isn't my first time building platforms that democratize complex technology—I did it with IoT in India, now doing it with AI globally.

## The Ask & The Opportunity

I'm raising a pre-seed round to:
1. Package the platform for external deployment
2. Onboard 10 pilot customers who've already expressed interest
3. Build the team that helped me scale this at Walmart

**Why Boundless is the perfect partner:**
- Your portfolio (Superhealth, Knot, PierSight) shows you understand infrastructure plays
- Your Stanford MBA + Oxford/Cambridge scientific background means you'll grasp both the technical depth and business leverage
- Your experience building Kae's GenAI thesis aligns with our enterprise AI focus

## The Vision: Every Company Becomes AI-Native

Just as Stripe made every company payments-enabled, we're making every company AI-decision-enabled. The companies using our platform won't just search for information—they'll understand intent and take action, capturing value at the decision point.

Would love to show you how we're turning months of AI development into days of configuration, letting companies focus on what makes them unique rather than rebuilding common AI infrastructure.

Best,
Shivang

P.S. Given your media background with Boundless Media and content expertise, you'll appreciate this: our platform can power everything from customer service bots to content curation engines to decision support systems—all using the same core infrastructure. The science stays consistent; the story adapts to each company's needs.
