Hi Aakash,

I've been following your work in really impressive stuff.

I'm building out our ML team and thought you might be interested in what we're tackling - it's a fascinating predictive analytics challenge. We're processing massive streams of unstructured data (web analytics, social feeds, behavioral signals) and building correlation models that actually deliver actionable insights in real-time.

The technical challenges are genuinely interesting - time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition at scale. Plus, it's fully remote with a team that values deep technical work over meetings.

Our stack: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Spark, and modern cloud infrastructure. But more importantly, we're solving problems that haven't been solved before.

Worth a conversation? Grab 20 minutes on my calendar: https://calendly.com/shivang-crtx/spatel

Looking forward to connecting,
Shivang Patel
