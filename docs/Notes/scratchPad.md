Hi Aakash,

I've been following your work in really impressive stuff.

I'm building out our ML team and thought you might be interested in what we're tackling - it's a fascinating predictive analytics challenge. We're processing massive streams of unstructured data (web analytics, social feeds, behavioral signals) and building correlation models that actually deliver actionable insights in real-time.

The technical challenges are genuinely interesting - time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition at scale. Plus, it's fully remote with a team that values deep technical work over meetings.

Our stack: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Spark, and modern cloud infrastructure. But more importantly, we're solving problems that haven't been solved before.

Worth a conversation? Grab 20 minutes on my calendar: https://calendly.com/shivang-crtx/spatel

Looking forward to connecting,
Shivang Patel


I dont think this is good framework for VC pitch deck. let's start by writing a white paper in true amazon style. 2 pages. can you get me standard flow they use? 

market opportunity: okay 
Competitive advanctages: most companies are focusing on easy part of AI automation - taking documents and providing QA chatbot. They lack on accuracy and complete end to end intergration and applying true agentic mindset to really get the ROI.
Revenue projects- how did you come up with? let's first come up with business model. 


1. Use the framework provided and write a paper in HTML format and link it to
legal_ai_strategic_analysis.html at bottom. 
you will limit the scope to LegalAI folder and use the markdown files as your context base.
you will use below agents.
