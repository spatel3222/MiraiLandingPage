 1. Customer Story Scope: Should the opening story show a law firm struggling with multiple inefficiencies (client intake, case management, billing, research, communication) rather than just document issues? >> yes
  2. End-to-End Solution: Should I position Mirai360.ai as transforming the entire law firm workflow from client first contact through case closure? >> yes
  3. Efficiency Focus: Should each section demonstrate how AI agents improve efficiency at every operational touchpoint? >> yes
  4. Next Step: Do you want me to:
    - Revise the customer story to show comprehensive workflow inefficiencies? >> yes but do not go too deep into this, keep it high level ot point that it makes sense for a executive reader. 
    - Focus on the complete AI transformation rather than just document management? >> yes 
    - Wait for your specific direction on which aspects to emphasize? >> Yes for each step and give me output on screen or name of file i should review. 

  What specific aspects of the end-to-end AI solution do you want me to emphasize in the white paper narrative? >> all the way from first client meeting, meeting notes automation, transcripts, generating case documents, MOST important personalize the agents to meet the law firms core competentices Otherwise if all the firms are using the same agents then they all will be same and that does not help them differentiate. 

The story outline is okay but it emphasizes way too much on the operation efficiencies. It is all about using AI tool not only help them with the operational efficiencies but also go above and beyond and push the bar. it allows them to scale faster efficiently over just hiring more people to get more cases done. 

retry and ask for approval aganin.

## White Paper for Legal AI

### Page 1: press release
	-  ₹5 Crore Ceiling >> what does this even mean?
	-  what is this Ceiling?? why are we using terms without defining it. 
	-  we start with positive win and then show how Mehta law firm won using our solution? over current flow of starting with problem 
**Working Backwards from Success: Our Vision Realized
- keep currency consistant at INR Rupee
- growth ceiling --> what does this term even mean to the reader? 
- with over 450 firms now handling cases 3x larger in value and complexity than their pre-AI capabilities allowed --> this metric for a startup seems unrealistic. do you even know how much mid-tier law firms are in India and does this number make sense at this stage of the company? >>> use market research agents to make sure the numbers make sense top-down and bottom up. Right now these feels like random numbers that cannot be believe even though they are synthenic. 
- There are too many numbers the flow should make sense. go top down. 
**The Journey: From Vision to Market Leadership
- crawl-walk-run should list the capabilites we will build to support x firms. 
- there are again too many numbers with forces dilutes the key message as the read is kept busy tracking the numbers and making sense out othe number. so pick 2-3 metric and see how that scales from crawl-walk-run phases as we build more capabilites. 

**Frequently Asked Questions**
- the numbers are without references at end as origianlly requested. 


ToDo
- update crawl-walk-run manually.

# Legal AI Oct 25 - Crawl Phase requirements

Claude-Logic ask prompt-optimizer to create a optimizated prompt: look at market research and product manager agent and help me define requirements for below phase. We want to just write high level ability. The goal is to package the current solution that we have built and make it self reliant for someone to use the portal. the user should login with approved email ID, upload their documents, get version of their digital twin. There needs to be version control.   look at attached screen capture. I want you to give me a requirements with pillars, L1 features (epic), and L2 features (user story) i also want you to create a user flow diagram.

  - Look at CRAWL phase in SUPPORTING FOLDER 
  - P0 features 
  	- Authenticate with approved email credentials
  	- Upload legal documents securely
  	- Generate versioned digital twins of their documents
  	- Manage document versions with full audit trail

  FRAMEWORK REFERENCE:

  This should be in table format 
  1. PRODUCT PILLARS - High-level capability areas aligned with the three strategic pillars
  2. L1 FEATURES (EPICS) - Major feature sets that deliver user value within each pillar
  3. L2 FEATURES (USER STORIES) - Specific user stories following "As a [user], I want [goal] so that
  [benefit]" format

  creation

  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
  - Focus on CRAWL phase capabilities for MVP (foundational features)
  - Emphasize self-service functionality requiring minimal support
  - Include robust authentication and version control throughout
  - Ensure scalability for boutique law firms (10-49 lawyers)
