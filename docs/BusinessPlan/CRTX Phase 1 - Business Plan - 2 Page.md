# CRTX Business Plan

## **Executive Summary**
CRTX transforms ambitious mid-market companies ($50M-$500M revenue) from AI experimentation to production reality in weeks, not years. We leverage Fortune 1 expertise from Walmart, Tesla, and Meta to help companies join the 5% that achieve real AI transformation (MIT: 95% fail to achieve ROI). Our **"Enterprise AI Built to Scale"** platform delivers measurable business outcomes through proven methodologies and pre-built industry solutions.

## **The Problem: 95% of AI Projects Fail**
MIT studied 300+ enterprise AI initiatives—only 5% achieve real transformation. The pattern is consistent: RAND (80% failure), Capgemini (88% never reach production), Gartner (30% abandoned after POC).

**Why Companies Fail:**
- **Wrong Starting Point**: 50% of budgets go to flashy sales/marketing tools when back-office automation delivers highest ROI
- **Build vs Buy Disasters**: Internal builds succeed 33% of the time; vendor solutions succeed 67%
- **Integration Chaos**: Teams work in silos—POCs that work in isolation fail at scale
- **Data Foundation Issues**: 46% of projects die from poor data quality

## **The CRTX Production Method™**
Our operating system guarantees success through five phases:

**Phase 1: Business Impact Mapping (Weeks 1-2)**
Map top 3 revenue/cost problems, calculate ROI targets, define measurable outcomes.

**Phase 2: Data Reality Check (Weeks 2-3)**
Audit data quality across 7 dimensions, build remediation roadmap. *If data quality < 60%, we pause to fix foundations*

**Phase 3: Production Blueprint (Weeks 3-4)**
Design end-to-end workflows, failover handling, system integration architecture. *Deliverable: Production-ready technical blueprint*

**Phase 4: Hybrid Team Assembly**
CRTX engineers paired with client experts, weekly sprints, knowledge transfer. *No expectation that IT becomes AI experts overnight*

**Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 4+)**
Weekly production releases, A/B testing, business metric monitoring. *Working system in 30 days with performance tracking*

**Result**: 95% of clients achieve positive ROI within 90 days vs industry average of 5% within 12 months
