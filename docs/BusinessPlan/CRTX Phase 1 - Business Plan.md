# CRTX Phase 1 - Business Plan

---

## **PRESS RELEASE**

CRTX Launches **"Enterprise AI Built to Scale"** Platform to Transform Mid-Market AI Implementation — *Proven to scale for every department* — Silicon Valley consulting firm combines Fortune 1-proven strategies from Walmart, Tesla, and Meta with startup agility to help companies join the 5% that achieve real AI transformation (MIT study: 95% fail to achieve meaningful ROI). The platform accelerates proof-of-concept to production scaling with built-in data privacy, security, and responsible AI frameworks trusted by legal, financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing clients. CRTX's reusable AI building blocks reduce implementation time by 50% while focusing directly on business outcomes rather than technology demos. The company targets firms ($50M-$500M revenue) that currently struggle with redundant AI development across departments, helping them create scalable, enterprise-grade platforms that deliver measurable business outcomes much sooner.

## **CUSTOMER PROBLEM**

**95% of Companies failes to launch their AI implemenation**

They invest millions in AI tools but fail to transform their business. MIT studied 300+ enterprise AI initiatives and found only 5% achieve real transformation. The technology works—the approach is broken.

**The Evidence Is Overwhelming**:
 Every major study shows the same pattern:
- MIT: 95% fail to achieve meaningful ROI from AI investments
- RAND Corporation: 80% of AI projects never deliver value
- Capgemini: 88% of POCs die before reaching production
- Gartner: 30% abandoned after proof of concept

**The Real Reasons Companies Fail**:

**They Start in the Wrong Place**: Companies deploy ChatGPT and expect magic. 50% of AI budgets go to flashy sales and marketing tools when the real ROI sits in back-office automation. They're solving visible problems, not valuable ones.

**They Build When They Should Buy**: Everyone wants to build their own AI. The data is brutal—internal builds succeed 33% of the time while vendor solutions succeed 67%. Pride kills more AI projects than technology limitations.

**They Create Integration Chaos**: Marketing builds a chatbot. Sales creates another. Customer service develops a third. None talk to each other. Generic AI tools can't handle company-specific processes. When real-world complexity hits, everything breaks.

**They Ignore the Foundation**: 46% of projects die from data quality issues. Companies rush to implement AI on broken data foundations. It's like building a skyscraper on sand—impressive until it collapses.

**The Bottom Line**: The technology works. The approach is broken. Companies need to stop thinking about AI as a tool and start thinking about it as a complete business transformation.

## **HOW THE 5% WIN: THE CRTX FRAMEWORK**

After helping dozens of companies implement AI successfully, here's what actually works:

1. **Start with Business Problems → Clear ROI**: Don't start with cool AI demos. Define success metrics before touching any technology.

2. **Quality Data Foundation**: Spend 60% of time on data preparation. Clean data beats fancy algorithms every time.

3. **Complete Workflow Solutions**: Map entire processes from start to finish. AI should enhance workflows, not create new ones.

4. **Right Skills From Day One**: Don't expect your current team to become AI experts overnight. Combine AI expertise with business understanding.

5. **Think Agents, Not Tools**: Automate entire processes with AI agents that handle complete workflows—automation at scale, not at the edges.

## **OUR SOLUTION: APPLIED AGENTIC AI PLATFORM**

CTRX enables companies to deploy enterprise-grade agentic AI systems at scale in record time and reudce cost with flexible ownership models. CRTX's Applied AI Platform is a multi-tenant, enterprise-grade solution built on microservices architecture with clear data segmentation and robust user management. The platform provides comprehensive agentic AI capabilities including agent creation, deterministic flow design, and our proven multi-agent orchestration, supported by content management, context management, and memory management services. Built on a pay-as-you-go model, the platform supports the latest mature agentic technologies including MCP and A2A protocols, with future roadmap items including bring-your-own-TPU and bring-your-own-instance options. While external agents are not supported in Phase 1, we provide seamless integration through JSON outputs that can be easily stitched to custom UIs, whether chatbots or dashboards. Out of the box, we provide two foundational agents: an enterprise RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent and a Data-to-SQL agent, powered by contextual AI and default AI services.
