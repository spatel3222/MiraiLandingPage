# CRTX Phase 1 - Business Plan

---

## **PRESS RELEASE**

CRTX Launches **"Build AI Once, Scale Everywhere" Platform** to Transform Mid-Market AI Implementation — Silicon Valley consulting firm combines Fortune 1-proven strategies from Walmart, Tesla, and Meta with startup agility to address the 78% AI project failure rate among ambitious companies. The platform accelerates proof-of-concept to production scaling with built-in data privacy, security, and responsible AI frameworks trusted by legal, financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing clients. CRTX's reusable AI building blocks reduce implementation time by 50% while focusing directly on business outcomes rather than technology demos. The company targets firms ($50M-$500M revenue) that currently struggle with redundant AI development across departments, helping them create scalable, enterprise-grade platforms that deliver measurable business outcomes much sooner.

## **CUSTOMER PROBLEM**

**The Current Reality**: 78% of companies use AI, but only 1% do it well. Most organizations waste millions building redundant AI solutions across teams. 88% of AI POCs don't make it to production[1], while 70-85% of GenAI deployments fail to meet ROI expectations[2]. You've seen the pattern: Marketing builds a chatbot. Sales creates their own. Customer service develops another. Each team reinventing the wheel while burning through budgets.
- **Redundant Development**: Marketing builds a chatbot, Sales creates another, Customer Service develops a third—each team reinventing the wheel
- **Skills Gap**: Lack Fortune 1-level expertise to implement enterprise-grade AI
- **Compliance Nightmares**: Struggle with HIPAA, financial regulations, and security requirements
- **Integration Hell**: Disconnected AI solutions that don't talk to each other
