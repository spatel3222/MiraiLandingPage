# LinkedIn Post: MCP - The USB-C for AI

🚀 **Model Context Protocol (MCP) is becoming the "USB-C for AI" – and enterprise leaders who ignore this shift risk being left behind.**

While most companies are still wrestling with basic API integrations, forward-thinking organizations are already leveraging MCP to create true agentic frameworks that think, decide, and act autonomously.

**The transformation is real:**
• Zapier evolved from simple "if-this-then-that" to intelligent workflow orchestration
• Composio now connects 500+ apps through unified agentic interfaces
• 1,000+ MCP servers deployed in just 3 months – faster adoption than REST APIs

**Why this matters for your business:**
Traditional APIs require human intervention for every decision. MCP-powered agents analyze context, make intelligent choices, and execute complex multi-step workflows without constant oversight.

Think beyond automation. This is about AI systems that understand your business context and optimize operations in real-time.

**The competitive advantage window is closing fast.** While your competitors are still building basic chatbots, MCP enables you to deploy AI agents that actually understand and improve your business processes.

Enterprise leaders: Are you building for yesterday's API world or tomorrow's agentic future?

The companies that master MCP today will define their industries tomorrow.
