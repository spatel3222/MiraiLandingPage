## Amazon-Style White Paper Framework: Working Backwards from Success

**Press Release - 18 Months Forward**

Mirai360.ai today announced it has achieved Series A funding of $15 million after revolutionizing how mid-tier law firms in India scale their operations, with over 450 law firms now using its personalized AI agents to handle 40% more complex cases while expanding into three new practice areas on average. The platform has enabled partner firms to achieve median revenue growth of 65% within 12 months of implementation, with standout customers like Sharma & Associates growing from a 15-lawyer firm handling primarily real estate disputes to a 35-lawyer practice successfully managing corporate mergers, intellectual property litigation, and international trade compliance—practice areas previously beyond their reach due to resource constraints. Customer retention sits at 94%, with firms reporting that Mirai360.ai's personalized agents don't just automate routine tasks but actively identify growth opportunities, draft complex legal strategies, and provide real-time market intelligence that enables them to compete for higher-value mandates traditionally reserved for top-tier firms. The company now processes over 2.3 million legal documents monthly across its network, capturing 8% of the addressable mid-tier legal services market in India's six major metropolitan areas, while individual partner firms report average case value increases of 180% as they confidently pursue sophisticated matters with AI-augmented capabilities. Leading industry association Legal Era recognized Mirai360.ai as "Technology Innovation of the Year," with founding customer Managing Partner Priya Mehta of Delhi-based Mehta Legal stating, "Mirai360.ai didn't just make us more efficient—it fundamentally transformed our ability to serve enterprise clients and tackle complex cross-border transactions we never thought possible for a firm our size, directly contributing to our expansion from 12 to 28 lawyers and our entry into three new high-value practice verticals."
