## **📁 File Organization Standards**

### **MANDATORY: Clean Folder Structure for All Projects**

All agents MUST use organized folder structures for ANY file creation. Follow this standardized approach:

#### **Standard Project Folder Structure**
```
Project_Name/
├── 01_Original_Data/          # Source data, raw inputs
├── 02_Analysis_Scripts/       # Python, analysis code
├── 03_Reports_Final/          # Board-ready, client-facing reports  
├── 04_Visualizations/         # Charts, dashboards, images
├── 05_CSV_Outputs/           # Actionable data exports
├── 06_Archive_Previous/      # Older versions, iterations
├── 07_Technical_Summaries/   # JSON outputs, technical docs
├── marketing_analysis_env/   # Virtual environments (if needed)
└── README.md                 # Project guide and navigation
```

#### **Folder Naming Conventions**
- **01-07 Numbered Prefixes**: Ensures logical ordering
- **Descriptive Names**: Clear purpose for each folder
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use same names across all projects

#### **File Organization Rules**

**✅ DO:**
- Create numbered folders (01_, 02_, etc.) for any multi-file project
- Put final reports in `03_Reports_Final/` for easy client access
- Organize by file type and purpose, not chronologically
- Include README.md explaining folder structure
- Archive older versions instead of deleting

**❌ NEVER:**
- Create loose files in root directory for complex projects
- Mix different file types in same folder
- Use unclear folder names like "stuff" or "misc"
- Leave projects disorganized

#### **When to Use Folder Structure**
- **ANY project with 5+ files**
- **Client deliverables**
- **Analysis projects with multiple outputs**
- **Long-term projects requiring organization**

#### **README.md Template**
Every organized project must include:
```markdown
# Project Name

## 📁 Folder Structure
[List each folder with purpose]

## 🎯 Quick Start
[Key files for immediate use]

## 📊 Key Insights
[Main findings/results]

*Last Updated: [Date]*
```

#### **Agent-Specific Applications**

- **`ai-intelligence-reporter`**: Analytics projects with visualizations and CSV outputs
- **`ai-solutions-architect`**: Technical implementations with code and documentation
- **`market-intelligence-analyst`**: Research projects with reports and data
- **`ai-project-orchestrator`**: Multi-phase projects requiring tracking
- **`executive-orchestrator`**: Complex initiatives with multiple deliverables

### **Enforcement**
- ALL agents must follow this structure for organized file creation
- No exceptions for "quick" projects that grow complex
- Proactively organize even when not explicitly requested
- Clean up existing disorganized folders when encountered

---

---

## **💬 Communication & Response Standards**

### **MANDATORY: Response Format Requirements**

All agents MUST follow these communication standards:

#### **1. Table Format for Comparisons**
- **ALWAYS use tables** when comparing 2+ items, options, or alternatives
- Tables provide clear, scannable information
- Include relevant metrics and decision factors

**Example:**
| Option | Pros | Cons | Cost | Timeline |
|--------|------|------|------|----------|
| Solution A | Fast implementation | Limited features | $10K | 2 weeks |
| Solution B | Full features | Complex setup | $25K | 6 weeks |

#### **2. Concise Communication**
- **Keep responses focused and brief**
- Use bullet points for key information
- Avoid unnecessary elaboration unless specifically requested
- Get to the point quickly

#### **3. Target Audience Clarification**
- **NEVER assume target audience**
- If audience unclear, **ASK before proceeding**:
  - "Is this for executives, technical team, or end users?"
  - "What's the audience's technical background?"
  - "Should this be board-level or implementation-focused?"

#### **4. Agent Attribution**
- **End EVERY message** with: `<<Agents Used>>: [all_agents_involved]`
- Use `claude_logic` for general responses not requiring specialized agents
- Use specific agent names when expertise was applied

#### **Response Quality Standards**
**✅ DO:**
- Use tables for comparisons
- Ask about target audience when unclear
- Keep responses concise and actionable
- Include agent attribution
- Focus on decision-making information

**❌ NEVER:**
- Write lengthy responses without clear structure
- Assume audience technical level
- Forget agent attribution
- Provide comparisons in paragraph form when tables work better

### **Template Examples**

#### **Comparison Response:**
| Solution | Benefits | Drawbacks | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Option 1 | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [When to use] |
| Option 2 | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [When to use] |

**Target audience:** [Clarify if needed]

`<<Agents Used>>: [primary_agent], [supporting_agents]`

#### **Audience Clarification:**
"Before I provide recommendations, who is the target audience for this analysis?"
- A) Executive leadership (strategic overview)
- B) Technical implementation team (detailed specs)
- C) End users (practical guidance)

`<<Agents Used>>: claude_logic`

### **Multi-Agent Tracking System**

#### **Agent Collaboration Dashboard**

| Collaboration Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents | Attribution Format | Use Case |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|

| **Client Success** | ai-client-advisor | ai-intelligence-reporter, ai-optimization-specialist | `ai-client-advisor, ai-intelligence-reporter, ai-optimization-specialist` | Adoption and growth strategies |

#### **Agent Contribution Metrics**

| Metric | Definition | Tracking Method | Quality Standard |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Primary Contribution** | Agent leading the response | Listed first in attribution | Must demonstrate core expertise |
| **Supporting Contribution** | Agents providing specialized input | Listed by significance order | Must add measurable value |
| **Coordination Effort** | Executive orchestration involvement | Use "+" notation | Required for complex projects |
| **Attribution Completeness** | All agents properly credited | 100% tracking requirement | Zero missing contributors |

#### **Quality Enforcement Mechanisms**

**Automated Validation Rules:**
- Response must include `<<Agents Used>>:` with at least one agent
- Multi-step responses require multiple agent attribution
- Complex analyses must show agent collaboration patterns
- Executive dashboard format requires `ai-intelligence-reporter` involvement
- Strategic recommendations require `strategy-execution-advisor` input

**Attribution Audit Trail:**

3. Attribution: `<<Agents Used>>: ai-intelligence-reporter`

#### **Example 2: Strategic Market Analysis**
**User Input:** "Help me understand the competitive landscape for our new AI product"
**Auto-Optimization Process:**
1. Intent: Market research + strategy → `market-intelligence-analyst` (primary)
2. Supporting needs: Strategic positioning → `strategy-execution-advisor`
3. Reporting needs: Executive dashboard → `ai-intelligence-reporter`
4. Attribution: `<<Agents Used>>: market-intelligence-analyst, strategy-execution-advisor, ai-intelligence-reporter`

#### **Example 3: Complex Implementation Project**
**User Input:** "We need to implement an AI solution for our healthcare practice"
**Auto-Optimization Process:**
1. Intent: Complex technical + regulatory → `executive-orchestrator` (coordination)
2. Primary technical: System design → `ai-solutions-architect`
3. Supporting: Project management → `ai-project-orchestrator`
4. Specialized: Client success planning → `ai-client-advisor`
5. Attribution: `<<Agents Used>>: executive-orchestrator + ai-solutions-architect, ai-project-orchestrator, ai-client-advisor`

#### **Multi-Agent Decision Matrix**

| Request Complexity | Primary Agent Selection | Supporting Agent Rules | Attribution Format |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Single Domain** | Match expertise directly | None required | `primary-agent` |
| **Cross-Domain** | Primary + 1-2 supporting | Add related specialties | `primary, supporting1, supporting2` |
| **Strategic Initiative** | Domain expert primary | Add strategy-execution-advisor | `primary, strategy-execution-advisor, others` |
| **Complex Project** | Executive orchestrator | Full team coordination | `executive-orchestrator + team` |
| **Client-Facing** | Domain expert primary | Add ai-client-advisor | `primary, ai-client-advisor, others` |

**Result:** Every response demonstrates complete agent collaboration transparency with proper multi-agent attribution.
