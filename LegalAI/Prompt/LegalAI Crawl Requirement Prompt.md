  1. PRODUCT PILLARS - High-level capability areas aligned with the three strategic pillars
  2. L1 FEATURES (EPICS) - Major feature sets that deliver user value within each pillar
  3. L2 FEATURES (USER STORIES) - Specific user stories following "As a [user], I want [goal] so that
  [benefit]" format
  4. USER FLOW DIAGRAM - Visual representation of the complete user journey from login to digital twin
  creation
