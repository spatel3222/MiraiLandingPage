# Mirai — The Future of Legal

**360° Legal Intelligence: From Companies to Courts**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**The legal workflow is a loop — but it's broken.**

- Companies generate **contracts** → disputes reach lawyers
- Lawyers litigate **cases** → cases reach courts
- Courts set **precedents** → precedents should inform future contracts

**Why it's broken:** Each stakeholder works in isolation.

| Stakeholder | What They Have | What's Missing | Impact |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Courts** | 311 Cr pages digitized,² ₹8,880 Cr spent¹ | No AI to surface precedents³ | 47M cases pending⁵ |
| **Lawyers** | Years of expertise in folders | No co-pilot to scale playbooks⁴ | Every matter from scratch |
| **Companies** | Contracts across departments | No risk intelligence | Surprises become litigation |

The infrastructure exists. The intelligence layer is missing.

---

## THE VISION

**One Platform. Three Stakeholders. Complete Loop.**

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│  COMPANIES  │ ──────→ │  LAW FIRMS  │ ──────→ │   COURTS    │
│             │         │             │         │             │
│ • Contracts │         │ • Research  │         │ • Cases     │
│ • Compliance│         │ • Drafting  │         │ • Precedents│
│ • Legal Ops │         │ • Case Mgmt │         │ • Hearings  │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
       ↑                                               │
       │                                               │
       └──────────────── KNOWLEDGE ────────────────────┘
```

**Network Effect:** Private data stays private. Public precedents connect everyone. Each participant compounds their own intelligence.

Mirai is the operating system that closes the loop — making every participant smarter with every interaction.

## THE APPROACH

**Agentic AI on a Sovereign Data Foundation**

### End-to-End Stack

We deliver the complete pipeline — not just software:

- **Foundation:** Hardware, OCR in 10 Indian court languages, on-premise infrastructure
- **Intelligence:** RAG, agentic workflows, citations
- **Interface:** Document management, eCourts integration, custom agent builder

Works with existing infrastructure or as turnkey deployment. Forward and backward compatible.

### Agentic AI Architecture

Specialized AI agents orchestrate complex legal workflows — contract review, case research, compliance tracking, drafting. Each agent reasons step-by-step, cites sources, and coordinates with others. Hallucination-resistant by design.

### Data Foundation

Intelligence requires data. We aggregate:

- Case records via eCourts/NJDG integration (Supreme Court, High Courts, District Courts, Tribunals)
- Legal journals, commentaries, articles
- Firm knowledge bases and matter history (private, per-firm)
- Contract repositories and playbooks (private, per-client)

### Security & Compliance

- **On-premise first:** Sensitive data never leaves the premises
- **DPDP Act ready:** Built for India's data protection requirements
- **Client-matter walls:** Role-based access, audit trails, confidentiality preserved
- **No cross-party learning:** Your data trains only your models. Firm playbooks stay isolated.

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Who pays and how much?**

| Segment | Size | Current AI Coverage | Opportunity |
|---------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Enterprise firms (50+ lawyers) | 500 firms | 20% (Lucio.ai: 100 firms) | ₹680 Cr |
| Mid-market (10-49 lawyers) | 2,000 firms | 0% | ₹400 Cr |
| Regional/Tier-2,3 cities | 400K practitioners | ~5% (basic tools) | ₹140 Cr |
| Vernacular legal processing | 85% of content | 0% | ₹300 Cr |

**Total Legal AI market:** ₹245 Cr (2024) → ₹885 Cr (2030) at 23% CAGR⁶

**Why now? e-Courts Phase III alignment.**

Phase III (₹7,210 Cr, 2023-2027) explicitly calls for AI/ML, OCR, and intelligent systems — but has no AI vendor.¹

| Phase III Objective | What We Provide |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Digitize 3,108 Cr legacy pages | OCR in 10 Indian court languages |
| OCR for case pendency analysis | RAG pipeline with analytics |
| AI/ML for intelligent scheduling | Agentic AI for case prioritization |
| Data-driven decision-making for judges | Similar case discovery, precedent analysis |
| Cloud data repository | Hybrid on-premise + cloud architecture |

Government is creating the **data**. We are the **intelligence layer**.

**Why us?**

We own the full stack — from scanner hardware to AI interface. Competitors sell software. We sell outcomes.

## BUSINESS MODEL

**SaaS + Seats + Agents**

| Phase | Pricing | Value Delivered |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Crawl (0–6 mo) | ₹2k–5k/user/mo | 30% productivity gains |
| Walk (6–12 mo) | ₹5k–8k/user/mo | AI intelligence + workflow automation |
| Run (12–18 mo) | ₹8k–12k/user/mo | Predictive litigation + judge models |

**Custom Agent Services:**
- Playbook development: ₹50k–2L per agent
- Firm-specific training: ₹1L–5L setup + maintenance
- Enterprise deployments: Custom pricing (on-premise, dedicated support)

**Revenue Mix:** Recurring SaaS (per-seat) + Fixed services (agent development, training, deployment)

## 12-MONTH ROADMAP

**Phased Capture: Lawyers (NOW) → Courts (NEXT) → Companies (LATER)**

| Quarter | Lawyers | Courts | Companies |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **0–3 mo** | Convert 2 pilots → paying | — | — |
| **3–6 mo** | +3 law firms; ₹10L ARR | Hardware partnerships | Market research |
| **6–9 mo** | +2 law firms; ₹18L ARR | POC launch | CLM design |
| **9–12 mo** | Total 7 firms; ₹25L ARR | POC validation | Pilot with 1 company |

**Network effect:** Each phase unlocks the next. Lawyers validate → Courts adopt → Companies follow.

```

**Private data stays private. Public precedents connect everyone.**

- Company's contracts = private (visible only to company + their lawyer)
- Lawyer's playbook = private (firm's competitive advantage)
- Court precedents = public (accessible to all via RAG)
