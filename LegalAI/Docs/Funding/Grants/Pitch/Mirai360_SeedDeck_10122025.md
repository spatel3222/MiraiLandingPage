**360° Legal Intelligence: From Companies to Courts**

*The operating system for India's legal ecosystem*

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### The links are broken.

```
Courts ↔ BROKEN ↔ Lawyers ↔ BROKEN ↔ Companies
         ↑                              │
         └──────── BROKEN ──────────────┘
```

| Link | What's Broken | Impact |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Courts ↔ Lawyers** | 311 Cr pages digitized but 85% vernacular — lawyers can't search | Precedents exist but invisible |
| **Lawyers ↔ Companies** | No playbook automation — every contract reviewed from scratch | Slow, expensive, error-prone |
| **Companies ↔ Courts** | No proactive risk intelligence — disputes surprise everyone | Litigation floods courts (47M pending)⁵ |

**So What:** The infrastructure exists. The links are broken. Intelligence layer is missing.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY

### Three markets. Three gaps. One platform.

**COURTS: ₹7,210 Cr (Phase III budget)¹**
- Pages digitized — zero AI to read them
- Govt explicitly calling for AI/ML vendors
- **Gap:** No vendor. First mover wins.

> *"₹53.57 Crore earmarked for AI and Blockchain integration across High Courts — but no comprehensive AI vendor selected."* — e-Courts Phase III Budget⁸

**LAWYERS: ₹885 Cr by 2030 (23% CAGR)⁶**
- 500 enterprise firms — 20% have AI (Lucio.ai)
- 2,000 mid-market firms — 0% AI coverage ← **our wedge**
- 150 elite boutiques — equivalent expertise, locked out by tech gap
- **Gap:** Mid-market completely underserved.

> *"Only 20-27% of law firms actively use sophisticated AI tools. Mid-market firms (<50 lawyers) lag at ~20% adoption vs 39% for large firms."* — Thomson Reuters Legal AI Report 2024⁹

**COMPANIES: ₹2,000 Cr → ₹4,000 Cr by 2033 (~8% CAGR)⁷**
- 71% of Indian enterprises faced compliance breaches
- No IronClad for India — global CLM players not localized
- **Gap:** Contract intelligence vacuum.

> *"42.4% of lawyers cite lack of India-specific context in AI tools — misinterpreting regional laws, local compliance."* — Wolters Kluwer Future Ready Lawyer Survey¹⁰

**Why now:** 18-24 month window before Big Tech localizes.

---

## SLIDE 4: THE VISION

### Lawyers (NOW) → Courts (NEXT) → Companies (LATER)

```
PHASE 1: LAWYERS (Now)
    │ Vernacular Support, Research Assistant
    │ List of Dates, Document Management
    │ Product-market fit validated
    ↓
PHASE 2: COURTS (6-8 months for POC)
    │ End-to-end: Hardware + Digitization + AI
    │ Scanner → OCR → RAG → Case Management
    │ Lawyers using Mirai → Courts trust Mirai
    ↓
PHASE 3: COMPANIES (8-12 months)
    │ CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) for India
    │ Lawyer playbook agents → evaluate/enforce client contracts
    │ B2B2B: Lawyers sell to their clients
```

**Network effect:** Each phase unlocks the next. Lawyers validate → Courts adopt → Companies follow.

**Data Sovereignty:** Your contracts, playbooks, work product = forever private. Court precedents, circulars, articles = shared intelligence via RAG.

---

## SLIDE 5: THE SOLUTION

### Deep dive: Why lawyers, what we built, how it works

**Why lawyers first?**
- Hub of the ecosystem — touch both courts AND companies
- Fastest to validate (pilots done)
- Revenue today, platform tomorrow

**What we've built:**

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Digital Twin** | Converts documents into AI-readable, structured, searchable format |
| **Vernacular Support** | Reads case files in 10 Indian court languages |
| **Research Assistant** | Knowledge base chat with citations, similar case & clause analysis |
| **List of Dates** | Auto-generates chronological case history |
| **Document Management** | Tabular view with auto-tagging, custom columns, chronological sorting |
| **Playbook Agents** | Lawyers create playbooks → run against contracts → auto-flag & redline |

---

## SLIDE 6: HOW IT'S DIFFERENT

### Mirai's Full-Stack Agentic AI Advantage

| Dimension | Mirai360 | Competitors |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Stack** | Hardware → OCR → RAG → **Agentic AI** → Interface | Software-only |
| **Data Model** | Digital twin (AI-readable, editable) | Off-the-shelf — no moat |
| **Languages** | 10 Indian court languages | English-first |
| **Deployment** | On-premise first (DPDP-ready) | Cloud-only |
| **Architecture** | **Lawyer-customizable agents** | Fixed chatbots |
| **Output** | Litigation-ready documents | Generic AI drafts |

**Strategic Outcome:** Competitors offer AI features. **Mirai offers the entire legal operating system — powered by Agentic AI.**

---

## SLIDE 7: TRACTION

### 3 Pilots. Product-Market Fit Validated.

**Pilot Feedback:**

> *"The combination of vernacular assistant and List of Dates is priceless. Many attempt this — none meet lawyer standards."*
> — Senior Partner, Top-tier Law Firm

> *"Integrated with eCourts for case and document management — bringing many silo products into one place."*
> — Senior Partner, Top-tier Law Firm

> *"Custom agents for research let our firm move fast while keeping our competitive ways of working secret."*
> — Senior Partner, Top-tier Law Firm

**What we proved:**
- Product-market fit — lawyers use AI that meets professional standards
- AI capabilities — vernacular OCR, research agents, document automation work at scale

## APPENDIX B: How the Loop Works

**Example: NDA Review → Dispute Prevention**

```
COMPANY                         LAWYER                          COURT
   │                               │                               │
   │ Drafts NDA                    │                               │
   ├──────── shares via Mirai ────→│                               │
   │                               │ Playbook auto-flags risks     │
   │←─────── flagged issues ───────┤                               │
   │ NDA executed safely           │                               │
   │                               │                               │
   │ --- If dispute arises ---     │                               │
   │                               │←── public case law via RAG ───┤
   │                               │ Suggests resolution path      │
   │←─────── resolution ───────────┤                               │
   │ Dispute resolved              │ Learnings stay private        │
```

**Private data stays private. Public precedents connect everyone.**
