1️⃣ What this call is REALLY about (read this first)

RTBI will be silently evaluating 4 things:

Founder quality – clarity of thought, depth, execution maturity

Problem legitimacy – is this real, urgent, India-specific

Technical defensibility – is this real deeptech or “LLM wrapper”

RTBI fit – can they genuinely help you succeed

They are not looking for:

Full pitch

Exact numbers

Perfect answers

They are looking for:

Signal over noise

Conviction without hype

Coachability + ambition

2️⃣ Your 30-second opening (MEMORIZE THIS)

They may ask:

“Shivang, can you briefly tell us about Mirai360?”

Use this exact structure:

“Mirai360 is building the operating system for India’s legal ecosystem.
Today, courts, lawyers, and companies all operate on fragmented systems despite massive digitization.
We use agentic AI, vernacular OCR, and on-prem deployment to automate legal workflows for law firms first—where we’ve completed two pilots with leading Indian firms—and then expand into courts and enterprise CLM.
Our focus is solving India-specific legal complexity that global tools don’t address.”

Stop. Don’t oversell. Let them ask next.

3️⃣ The 6 questions RTBI is MOST likely to ask (with strong answers)
Q1. “Why start with lawyers?”

Answer:

Lawyers are the hub of the legal system—they interact with courts and companies daily.
They’re also the fastest validation layer. Our pilots showed that if we meet lawyer-grade standards, adoption follows naturally into courts and enterprises.

Signal: You understand go-to-market sequencing.

Q2. “How are you different from Lucio, Casemine, etc.?”

Answer:

Most players focus on research or drafting.
We focus on workflow automation + intelligence, built for Indian conditions—vernacular documents, on-prem requirements, and customizable AI agents.
Lawyers don’t want another chatbot; they want playbooks that scale their expertise.

Signal: You understand competitive gaps deeply.

Q3. “Is this defensible? What’s your moat?”

Use the 3-layer moat (simple, strong):

Data moat – Vernacular legal documents + firm playbooks

Workflow moat – Agents embedded into daily legal ops (high switching cost)

Deployment moat – On-prem / sovereign architecture aligned with DPDP + courts

Together, these make Mirai hard to replace and hard to copy.

Q4. “What stage are you at right now?”

Be crisp and honest:

We’re post-pilot, pre-revenue.
The next 6–9 months are about converting pilots into paid deployments, expanding to 5–7 firms, and running a court integration POC.

RTBI likes this stage.

Q5. “How much funding are you looking for and why?”

We’re exploring ₹75L–₹1Cr via incubation + seed support.
The goal isn’t speed—it’s deep validation, product hardening, and credibility for court and government integrations.

This aligns perfectly with RTBI’s mandate.

Q6. “Why IIT Madras / RTBI?”

This is important. Say this explicitly:

RTBI sits at the intersection of deeptech, public infrastructure, and AI systems, which is exactly where Mirai operates.
Access to technical mentorship, credibility with government bodies, and structured seed pathways is more valuable to us right now than just capital.

This tells them: you chose them deliberately.

4️⃣ Likely follow-ups (be ready)

They may probe:

Timeline to revenue → 6–9 months

Team size → lean, senior-heavy
Court integrations → POC aligned with e-Courts Phase III
IP → architecture + workflows + data, patents optional later
If you don’t know something:
“That’s something we’re validating, and we’re open to RTBI’s guidance.”
That’s a plus, not a minus.

5️⃣ Questions YOU should ask them (this matters)

Ask 2–3 only:

“What has RTBI seen work best for deeptech founders at our stage?”
“How does RTBI typically support startups engaging with government or public digital infrastructure?”
“Which seed or grant pathways do you think we should prioritize through RTBI?”
This flips the dynamic—you become a peer, not an applicant.

6️⃣ Tone & mindset (important)
Calm, not rushed
Visionary, not defensive
Technical, not jargon-heavy
Confident, not salesy

You are ahead of most applicants—pilots + clear thesis already put you in the top bucket.


Why Mirai360 fits RTBI’s mission (use this framing) -- If asked “Why do you think RTBI is a fit for you?”, you can say

“RTBI’s mission of turning deeptech into deployable public-impact systems closely aligns with Mirai360.
We’re not building a legal chatbot—we’re building infrastructure for India’s justice ecosystem, designed for vernacular data, sovereign deployment, and institutional adoption.
That kind of work needs patient capital, technical mentorship, and ecosystem credibility, which is exactly RTBI’s strength.”


How much funding are you looking for?

“We’re looking for milestone-aligned seed support, ideally through RTBI and SISFS, to convert pilots into paid deployments and execute a court integration POC.
Based on our roadmap, we expect this to be in the ₹75L–₹1Cr range, but we’re flexible on structure and guidance from RTBI.”
