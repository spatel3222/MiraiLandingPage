## Mirai360 Opportunity

### Market Entry Strategy

```
PHASE 1: LAWYERS (Now)
    │ Build playbook agents for contract review
    ↓
PHASE 2: COURTS (6-8 months)
    │ Integrate with eCourts for dispute context
    ↓
PHASE 3: COMPANIES (24-36 months)
    │ CLM platform powered by lawyer playbooks
    │ Distribution via law firms (B2B2B)
```
