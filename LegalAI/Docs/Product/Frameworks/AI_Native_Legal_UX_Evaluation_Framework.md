# AI-Native Legal UX Evaluation Framework
**The CRTX Legal AI Interface Assessment Standard (CLAIAS)**

*Positioning CRTX.in as the definitive authority in AI-native legal interface design and evaluation*

---

## Executive Summary

The CLAIAS framework represents the first comprehensive, quantitative evaluation methodology specifically designed for AI-native legal interfaces. Developed by CRTX.in's Legal AI Research Division, this framework addresses the critical gap in evaluating whether AI integration truly enhances legal workflow efficiency versus merely adding technological complexity.

**Framework Purpose**: Establish measurable standards for evaluating AI-native legal interfaces during prototype development, competitive analysis, and market positioning for Mirai360.ai's CRAWL phase development.

**Strategic Value**: Positions CRTX.in as the thought leader in legal AI UX innovation while providing practical evaluation tools that competitors cannot easily replicate due to deep legal domain expertise requirements.

---

## Framework Overview

### Three-Parameter Evaluation Model

The CLAIAS framework evaluates AI-native legal interfaces across three weighted dimensions:

```
Final Score = (Integration Score × 0.45) + (Authority Score × 0.35) + (Efficiency Score × 0.20)
```

**Weighting Rationale**:
- **Integration (45%)**: Highest weight - AI-native integration is the primary differentiator
- **Authority (35%)**: Critical for legal profession trust and adoption
- **Efficiency (20%)**: Important but secondary to integration quality and professional trust

## Parameter 1: AI Integration Authenticity (Weight: 45%)
*"How seamlessly is AI woven into the legal workflow vs. bolted on as an afterthought?"*

### Definition
Measures the degree to which AI capabilities feel native to legal workflows rather than supplemental tools or features. Evaluates whether the AI enhances natural legal thinking patterns or creates additional cognitive overhead.

### Scoring Criteria (1-5 Scale)

#### **5 - Invisible AI Excellence**
- AI capabilities emerge naturally from legal tasks without explicit invocation
- System anticipates lawyer needs and provides insights contextually
- AI suggestions align perfectly with legal reasoning patterns
- Zero learning curve for core AI features
- **Examples**: 
  - Case law suggestions appear automatically during brief writing
  - Contract risk analysis updates in real-time as clauses are drafted
  - Precedent recommendations surface based on factual patterns being analyzed

#### **4 - Highly Integrated**
- AI features require minimal explicit activation
- Strong contextual awareness across legal documents and workflows
