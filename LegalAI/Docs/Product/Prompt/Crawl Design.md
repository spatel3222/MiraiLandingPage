#Crawl Design

**Goal:** Generate UI and UX design for Crawl Phase

**Knowledge Base :**
1. Mirai360_Complete_White_Paper_Series_A.md 
2. Legal_AI_Portal_PRD_CRAWL_Phase.md

**Branding :** 
/Users/shivangpatel/Documents/GitHub/LegalAI/Assets

## Working Folder
1. /Users/shivangpatel/Documents/GitHub/crtx.in/LegalAI
2. Output - Miro design with flows for Crawl phase
3. Output - tool use Miro to build design 

## Phase 1 : Research
1. Ask the strategy-execution-advisor &  ai-thought-leadership-engine to go through Knowledge Base and help us create a OS for lawyers that is agentic and AI first at core.
2. The flow should be such that does not look like AI is added as a after throught. It should be intergrate part of the UI and UX. 
3. As you break the ask into small task always keep human in loop to make sure you are able to get the inforamtion they have in mind. 
>> Output: give me a miro mind map to show what we are thinking. give me text on screen on trade off.  I want a framework to quantity the UX using 3 parameters that are clearly defined and quantifiable from scale of 1 to 5 and each one aggregated with weighted aveage to come up to 1 to 5 score. Share in information on screen. 

## Phase 2 : Prototype
1. ai-experience-designer will use brand guidance in Branding folder to build the Prototye
2. the Prototye should use the mind map and strategy set in phase 1
3. you will proudce 3 options
4. build a simple HTML files for each option in /Users/shivangpatel/Documents/GitHub/LegalAI/UX/Prototye folder
5. after we iterate on few options with human in loop, we will finalize one version
6. you will use Typewrite tool to get a screen capture of your design and get visual feedback on the design to make sure it is aligned in vision set get Phase 1. 
7. Measure the performance of each option against fixed framework in phase 1 and iterate 2 times to improve the score from ai-thought-leadership-engine.md and visual-storyteller.md to 4.5/5 using Generate screen captures of all 3 prototypes using Playwright  
## Phase 3 : Miro design
1. after getting human inputs on final design you will create final design in miro 
2. you will build a flow with each component

## Rules
1. never make up information only limit to provided Knowledge Base
2. if you need additional information, you can ask on screen for human inputs
3. always keep main context active. 
4. create temp files in a folder do not dump everything in one working folder.
