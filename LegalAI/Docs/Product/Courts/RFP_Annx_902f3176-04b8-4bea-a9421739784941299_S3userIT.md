THE REGISTRAR (COMPUTERISATION)-CUM-DIRECTOR(IT)
HIGH COURT OF KERALA
ERNAKULAM, KOCHI

# Page 2

The High Court of Kerala, the apex judicial authority in the state, was established
on 1st November 1956 with its seat at Ernakulam, following the reorganization of states
under the State Reorganisation Act, 1956. The Court's formation was a result of the
integration of the Travancore-Cochin State and the Malabar region to create the State of
Kerala. Prior to this, the High Court of Travancore-Cochin was inaugurated on 7th July
1949, also seated at Ernakulam, after the merger of Travancore and Cochin on 1st July
1949. Upon its establishment, the High Court of Kerala inherited 3,409 main cases from
the Travancore-Cochin High Court and 1,504 cases from the Madras High Court. Its
territorial jurisdiction extends over the entire State of Kerala and the Union Territory of
Lakshadweep. Presently, there are 567 trial Courts functioning in 181 court complexes in
the State of Kerala.

The High Court of Kerala, in alignment with the digitisation drive initiated by the e-
Committee of the Supreme Court of India, aims to digitise the entire court records of the
District Judiciary across the State. As part of this initiative, a comprehensive project has
been undertaken to digitise court records, including scanning, indexing, storing,
archiving, and retrieving both pending and disposed files, along with other relevant
records. This process also involves word processing and the digital entry of all details
from handwritten order sheets, ensuring secure storage of data. Digitisation work has
already commenced in 10 court complexes across Kerala. In furtherance of this initiative,
the High Court now intends to extend the digitisation process to the remaining 161 court
complexes (the actual number of court complexes may slightly vary) and the court
complexes which may be established in future. The scope of work is outlined in detail in
the following sections of this document.

This project is conceived as a **turnkey** solution to be executed by a single Service
Provider. The scope of work encompasses the entire digitisation process, including
scanning, text recognition, indexing, document taxonomy, and the application of
keywords (with support for nested keywords and hierarchies).

The primary objectives of this project are the preservation and indexing of records,
which includes the addition of missing or enhanced metadata, keywords, and other


---

# Page 3

parameters to ensure efficient retrieval and search capabilities across all records. These
records are dynamic, with the volume increasing daily due to new filings. Therefore, the
project also includes establishing systems and protocols for the digital capture of new
filings and materials, in addition to pending/disposed case records and administrative
files.

The Service Provider will be required to manage all aspects of the project until
completion, including daily progress reporting to the designated Officer of the Court
concerned. Daily throughput targets will be established, and it is the Service Provider's
responsibility to meet these targets, ensuring the output conforms to the specified
standards. The performance of the Service Provider will be closely monitored, with both
quantitative and qualitative standards being upheld.

An essential component of the project involves surveying and understanding existing
workflow patterns to establish protocols for digitisation without disrupting ongoing
work. digitised records must be 'reinstated'—restored to their original condition,
including binding and arrangement. Therefore, the Service Provider must ensure a well-
organized sequencing of the digitisation process, with checks at various stages to
maintain quality and order.

The Service Provider shall be responsible for providing comprehensive services,
including scanning, indexing, metadata entry, digital storage, and a data retrieval
interface. The Service Provider must ensure that they have the required server
infrastructure or an alternatw solution, as specified by the High Court to facilitate
efficient digital storage and quick retrieval of digitised records and documents
throughout the digitisation process. Until the project is completed, the Service Provider
must securely store all scanned documents on their intermediate server.

The Courts in the Court Complexes listed in Annexure I shall provide floor
space and electricity for the execution of the project and the Service Provider has to
provide all other facilities required for the execution of the project at its own cost. In
Court Complexes listed in Annexure II where sufficient space is unavailable to establish
a digitisation centre, the Service Provider is required to set up alternative arrangements.
These alternatives may include mobile digitisation units, temporary/makeshift


---

# Page 4

arrangements, or other external provisions, as the Court Complexes may be unable to
provide the necessary space or electricity for the digitisation activities. Wherever such
alternative facilities are provided, as approved by the High Court, a 25% increase in the
per page rate quoted will be considered. Details of the project and specifications are
provided in the Tender document.

# Page 11

### 3.3.1. Brief Description of the Project:
These Terms of Reference are for the turnkey project for Digitisation of files/documents of the Courts in the District Judiciary and porting of Data on Content Management System / Document Management System. The High Court is looking for a turnkey Service Provider who will scan and digitise Records in the Legal / A4 and / or such other sizes as found in files, create the additional/missing metadata and port the entire digitised collection into the District Case Management System (DCMS) or such other systems as specified by the High Court through which the uploaded digitised documents can be managed, indexed, catalogued and searched. Considering the importance of the records to be digitised, all the records shall only be digitised within the premises of the Court Complexes concerned, and no physical document and digital document shall allowed to be carried/transmitted/shared/transferred/sent out of the Court Complexes concerned at any point of time, except under the orders of the High Court.

### 3.3.2.
There are 161 Court Complexes (the actual number of court complexes may slightly vary) across the State where the digitisation work needs to be carried out. The work will have to be executed in a phased manner as proposed by the High Court.

### 3.3.3.
In Court Complexes listed in Annexure - II, where sufficient space is unavailable to establish a digitisation centre, the Service Provider is required to set up alternative arrangements. These alternatives may include mobile digitisation units, temporary/makeshift arrangements, or other external provisions, as the Court Complexes may be unable to provide the necessary space or utilities (such as electricity) for the digitisation activities. In such cases, a **25% increase** in per page rate will be considered to account for the additional facilities provided by the Service Provider.

### 3.3.4.
The Service Provider is expected to bring in (including, but not limited to): All equipment, software & hardware (computers, scanners, cameras, furniture, power backups, air conditioners including intermediary storage and servers etc.) required to set up a Digitisation Centre within the Court premises where the said scanning and indexing work will be done. The Service Provider can take back the said equipment upon the completion of the assignment after deletion of the records from the equipment used for the purpose. Necessary approvals from the appropriate authority, as decided by the High Court, shall be obtained in this regard.

### 3.3.5. Objectives of Digitisation:
The need for preservation, coupled with the need for improving accessibility (which can only be achieved by digital storage and an efficient database management retrieval system) is the need of the hour for catalyzing the current


---

# Page 12

initiative on digitisation of files/documents in the Courts in the District Judiciary. The
High Court proposes to use open source technology for its Content Management
System/Document Management System and with PostgreSQL database. In view of the
above, the primary objectives of the proposed initiative are:

(a) Preservation - preservation of the entire records is the foremost objective. Once
the documents are scanned and digitised, preservation of the original can be ensured
for a much longer period as the need to handle the physical documents would be
eliminated or minimized largely since digital documents would be made available
through such systems, as decided by the High Court.
(b) Accessibility and Availability - The District Case Management System would
make the District Judiciary files more accessible to all stakeholders, including those
who cannot visit the Courts. The documents and information held by the District
Judiciary can be easily accessed, only if the metadata is made available on the
internet/intranet.
(c) Enhance Searchability - All files would be linked based on subjects, keywords,
notes or any other criteria making a tremendous amount of data easily available on
any subject matter.
(d) Electronically sending memos / circulars to the other Courts and various State /
Central Government departments within a quick spell of time with the help of
Internet / Intranet.
(e) Creating catalogue and portfolio of the scanned case files and other records.

### 3.3.5.1. Broad Description of District Judiciary files that are to be digitised:
The files/documents at the District Judiciary collectively and principally consist of the
following, but not limited to:
- Judicial Files
- Administrative Files

### 3.3.6. Brief descriptions of type of files / documents to be digitised are given below:
(a) Pleadings, applications/petitions, vakalaths, exhibits, depositions, processes,
memo, annexures etc. and all other documents found in a case file.
(b) Judgements/Orders including interim orders typed or handwritten or printed or a
combination of these (for instance a typed note sheet with handwritten marking
in the margins). In case of judgements/interim orders, two sets of digitised


---

# Page 13

copies, one with signature of the Judge, and another masking the signature of the
Judges, shall be prepared.
(c) All records in administrative files (note files and correspondence files to be
scanned separately).
(d) A single record may consist of one or several pages.
(e) Normally, the size of the paper upon which pleadings in the Judicial Record shall
largely be in foolscap. It may be noted that the paper size may vary from Legal,
A3,A4,A5, stamp sized etc and / or such other sizes as found in files. The Service
Provider has to scan all the documents irrespective of the page size.
(f) Most of the documents are on papers largely printed in black colour. Some parts
may contain other colours. Documents included in the judicial records may
contain colour photographs, architectural plans, survey plans and the like.
**Disclaimer:** Please note that the above-mentioned type of documents are only an
indication and the Service Provider has to digitise any document in the form of books
or paper of any size and colour or contents of any digital storage media like
CD/DVD/hard disk/flash drive etc. that is provided by the Courts in the District
Judiciary from time to time for digitisation.

---

# Page 21

Step 1 - All the files for the digitisation will be supplied to the Service Provider by the Court
concerned, in batches, assigning unique batch identification numbers. The size and content
of a batch shall be determined by the Court based on the nature of the documents being
scanned. The Service Provider shall be responsible for collecting them to carry out the
digitisation work. Entry to the Digitisation Centres will be restricted to authorised personnel
only.
The Service Provider shall provide a comprehensive web application for batch creation,
incorporation of pre-scanning data, file/batch management, file/batch tracking, generation of
customised reports for verification of the progress of digitisation on daily/weekly/monthly
basis.

- The web application should have a user friendly graphical interface for easily
  identifying the progress in digitisation across various stakeholders.
- All costs including development, web hosting, application security auditing during
  the period of digitisation shall be borne by the Service Provider.
- The application should provide role based access, and detailed functionalities of
  the application shall be developed in consultation with the High Court.
- The application should be ready for operation before signing the contract.
- The Service Provider shall hand over the above application along with its source
  code and all rights associated with it, to the High Court, on completion of the
  digitisation project.
- The Service Provider shall ensure the security of data, servers, web applications
  etc. and shall ensure security measures like firewall, geo-fencing etc. in
  consultation with the High Court. The Service Provider shall also establish a
  suitable disaster recovery mechanism during the digitisation project.

Step 2 - Inward batch/files shall be verified by the Service Provider and shall acknowledge
receipt of such batch/files and inform the representative of the Court concerned in the
District Judiciary, if any discrepancy is noted. On the receipt of batches/files, the Service
Provider shall enter the following details against each file, in the web application:

- Name/Number of the file/batch received.


---

# Page 22

- Size of the pages in each file (A4, legal, A3 and / or such other sizes as found in
files) along with the count.
- The total number of pages in each file.
- Condition of the file: Normal/Fragile/Torn
- Person from whom the file/batch is collected (District Judiciary Official)
- Date of Collection of file/batch.

The Service Provider shall store the files/batches so received safely. Old/fragile files
shall be safely kept in plastic folders. All files shall be easily retrievable till the Quality
Check is passed.

### Step 3
The Service Provider shall undertake the removal of dust, removal of tags, pins,
threads, rubber bands etc. and sorting & numbering of pages in the document file in the
correct order. The Service Provider shall carefully unfold and flatten the documents, if
required, to eliminate creases and wrinkles. The Service Provider shall take special care in
preparing the documents which are too old and that may not be in good physical condition.
This may include (but not limited to) pasting of torn pages, straightening of pages, un-
binding of files that cannot be scanned directly. Some documents, which are folded at the
edges, may even require ironing to straighten them. The Service Provider shall take extreme
care towards handling of documents to maintain the sequence of records in the files. For
example, Multi-page documents that must be kept together (e.g., Note File and its Current
File, Enclosures like Letter with an attachment)

The metadata pertaining to files as available in electronic form, will be shared with
the Service Provider. The Content Management System/Document Management System
shall consume that metadata. During the scanning process, the metadata of scanned files
shall be verified by the Service Provider, with the physical files. Missing / additional fields
have to be identified by cross-checking with the physical file on a case-to- case basis. All
missing/additional data shall be entered by the Service Provider, and submit it for the
approval of the Court concerned. If any defect is noted on returning the file, the Service
Provider shall cure those defects, and resubmit the file for approval. Once approved, the
metadata will be auto consumed to DCMS or such other system specified by the High Court,
through API.


---

# Page 23

Step 4 - The scanned document in searchable PDF format i.e in PDF/A-2b will have to be
uploaded in the Content Management System/Document Management System for
verification. The Administrative and Judicial files shall be scanned separately. All the pages
of a single file have to be merged together to generate an exact replica of the physical file.
All the uploaded files should be bookmarked. The data should be integrated with DCMS or
such other systems specified by the High Court.

The Content Management System/Document Management System should be capable
of uploading the scanned “Files”, on-site from the scanning location at the court concerned.

The Metadata of each case file is required to be recorded in the PDF file itself. The
Metadata inserted inside the PDF must conform to the XMP specification for storing rich
Metadata, which enables importing of the Metadata fields directly in the Content
Management System/Document Management System to the DCMS or such other system
specified by the High Court. Annotations and bookmarks for the relevant pages are also
required to be recorded in the PDF files and stored as separate attributes in the database for
searching purposes.

XML output of the Metadata with other details of the PDF files is also required to be
simultaneously generated by the Service Provider.

The Service Provider will be responsible for quality assurance and will go through
all documents to see if they are complete and legible. The Service Provider will undertake
Quality Assurance processes for all aspects of processing and post-processing of records
including image capture, indexing, storage and return. The Service Provider will perform
quality checks to ensure that each page is fully rendered, properly aligned, and free of
aliasing/ distortions. When necessary (e.g., poor image capture of an illustration), the
Service Provider will re-scan the original file and insert the image(s) into the proper image
file sequence. The Final Quality Check will be done by the District Judiciary in consultation
with the High Court.

Step 5 - After the approval by the Court concerned, the scanned files will have to be
uploaded to the DCMS or such other system specified by the High Court.

Step 6 - The physical files after digitisation, shall be returned to the sections concerned in
batches in their original form. The Service Provider shall be liable for any damage/loss of
the documents collected. The web application should cross check the digitised files with


---

# Page 24

respective batches, and should indicate mismatch, if any. On the return of batches/files, the
Service Provider shall complete the file details in the web application, by entering the
following.
• Returned to (Court Official).
• Returned by (bidder representative).
• Date of return.
Step 7 - If there is any error in step 1 to step 6, the files should be returned for curing the
defects.
Step 8 - On final approval, the digitised files will be uploaded to the DCMS or such other
system specified by the High Court by a designated officer/s of the District Judiciary, by
affixing digital signature.

# Annexure - III
Digitisation of Files of Courts in District Judiciary - Specifications & Functionalities of Web
Application to be developed by Service Provider of Digitisation.

[The Service Provider is under obligation to provide a suitable internet-based web
application for tracking the inward and outward movement of files for digitisation and progress of
digitisation. The software should have the capability to generate customised MIS reports of the
various status of digitisation i.e. daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly, as specified by the High
Court. The Web Application should be comprehensive and should facilitate functionalities like
batch creation, incorporation of pre-scanning data, file/batch management, file/batch tracking, and
generation of customised reports for verification of the progress of digitisation on
daily/weekly/monthly basis.

The web application should have a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to
easily browse through various options and helps them identify the progress in digitisation across
various stakeholders.

The Service Provider shall bear all costs, including development, web hosting, and
application security auditing, during the period of digitisation.]
Proposed functionalities of the Web Application to be developed for facilitating digitization
project
## 1. User Management and Role-Based Access Control

# Page 99

c) Customizable roles to address institution-specific needs.
d) Separate Dashboards:

Court Dashboards: For individual courts to manage local digitization workflows.

Admin Dashboards: For overarching management and monitoring across multiple
courts.

Service Provider Dashboard: For service providers to view, manage, and update
digitization tasks.

Audit Logs: Comprehensive activity logs for all user actions to ensure compliance,
security, and accountability. These logs will be exportable for review and auditing
purposes.

## 2. Role Management
a) Predefined and Customizable Roles:

Assign predefined roles, such as Batch Manager, File Coordinator, and Monitoring
Official.

Create and manage custom roles to suit evolving institutional requirements.

b) Dynamic Role Control: Admins will have the ability to:

Grant and revoke role-based permissions in real time.

Temporarily suspend user access in cases of misuse or policy changes.

## 3. Batch Preparation Module
Batch Creation:

Provision to create file batches, assign unique identifiers, and categorize them by priority or
type.

Bulk upload options to add multiple files to a batch efficiently.


---

# Page 100

Metadata Management: Enable tagging of files and batches with relevant metadata for easier
tracking and retrieval.
Error Detection: System to flag inconsistencies (e.g., duplicate files, missing metadata)
during batch creation.
## 4. Batch Transmission Module
File Transfer Mechanism:
Secure, encrypted transmission of file batches from court dashboards to the service provider.
Acknowledgement receipts to confirm the successful transfer.
Transmission Tracking: Logs of all transmitted batches for future reference.
## 5. Real-Time Progress Monitoring
Status Updates:
Real-time tracking of digitization progress with detailed metrics, including:
Number of batches sent, processed, and pending.
Number of files digitized versus total files sent.
Digitization speed and expected completion times.
Granular Monitoring: Insights to the:
Batch level: Progress status for individual batches.
Court level: Overview of digitization status for each court.
District Judiciary level: Aggregate progress reports.
Alert Mechanism: Notifications for delays, errors, or completion of digitization
processes.


---

# Page 101

# 6. File Recall Mechanism
## Recall Provisions:
Courts can recall files included in a batch at any stage before digitization.

Justification for recall will be logged for record-keeping.

Return Mechanism: Reintegrate recalled files into the digitization workflow post-use.

# 7. Additional Functionalities (Recommended)
## Data Security and Backup:
End-to-end encryption for all data transfers.

Automatic backups to prevent data loss.

## Reports and Analytics:
Generate detailed reports for stakeholders, including performance summaries, pending tasks, and digitization trends.

Export reports in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, Excel).

## Integration with Existing Systems:
API support for seamless integration with existing court management systems or third-party tools.

## Notifications and Alerts:
Email and SMS notifications for key milestones or actions, such as batch transfers, recalls, or errors.
